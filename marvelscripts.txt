          FADE IN:

          On the blackness of SPACE, beautiful and mysterious, strewn
          with a billion stars.
          Atop a building, a wrought-iron sign -- a HAMMER-WIELDING
          BLACKSMITH -- spins listlessly in the wind as a swirling
          breeze kicks up. A hint of what's to come.

           EXT. PUENTE ANTIGUO, NEW MEXICO - NIGHT 

          A main street extends before us in this one-horse town, set
          amid endless flat, arid scrubland. A large SUV slowly moves
          down the street and heads out of town.

           EXT. SUV - NIGHT 

          The SUV sits parked in the desert. Suddenly, the roof panels
          of the SUV FOLD OPEN. The underside of the panels house a
          variety of hand-built ASTRONOMICAL DEVICES, which now point
          at the sky.
          JANE FOSTER (late 's) pops her head through the roof. She
          positions a MAGNETOMETER, so its monitor calibrates with the
          constellations above. It appears to be cobbled together from
          spare parts of other devices.

                         JANE
          Hurry!
          We hear a loud BANG followed by muffled CURSING from below.
          Jane offers a hand down to ERIK SELVIG () who emerges as
          well, rubbing his head.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          Oh-- watch your head.

                         SELVIG
          Thanks. So what's this "anomaly"
          of yours supposed to look like?

                         JANE
          It's a little different each time.
          Once it looked like, I don't know,
          melted stars, pooling in a corner
          of the sky. But last week it was a
          rolling rainbow ribbon--

                         SELVIG

                         (GENTLY TEASING)
          "Racing "Ëœround Orion?" I've always
          said you should have been a poet.
          Jane reigns in her excitement. She tries for dignity.

                         JANE
          Hey, Darcy. Pass up the bubbly and
          my gloves, will you?
          Intern DARCY LEWIS () hands Jane a bottle of Champagne and
          a pair of gloves through the window. Jane passes it to
          Selvig to hold while she pulls on the old gloves -- too large
          and masculine for her small hands. He starts to unwrap the
          foil, and she stops his hand with an excited grin.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          Not until you see it!

                         SELVIG
          (re: the gloves)
          I recognize those. Think how proud
          he'd be to see you now.
          Jane's grin fades to a sad smile.

                         JANE
          Thank you.

                         SELVIG
          For what?

                         JANE
          The benefit of the doubt.
          The two stare out at the sky expectantly. A long beat while
          they scan the skies. Nothing. Jane's worried.
           
          

          JANE (CONT'D)
          It's never taken this long before.
          Darcy calls up from the front seat.

          DARCY (O.S.)
          Can I turn on the radio?

                         JANE
          (an edge to her voice)
          Sure, if you like rocking out to
          KFRM, "All agriculture, all the
          time."
          Worried, Jane heads back down into the vehicle.

           INT. SUV - NIGHT 

          The SUV is bathed in the glow of high-tech monitoring
          equipment and laptops, some looking like they're held
          together with duct tape. Jane opens a well-worn NOTEBOOK of
          handwritten notes and calculations. Selvig watches the
          frustrated Jane with sympathy.

                         JANE
          The anomalies are always
          precipitated by geomagnetic storms.
          She shows him a complicated CHART she's drawn in the book,
          tracking occurrences and patterns.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          The last seventeen occurrences have
          been predictable to the minute... I
          just don't understand.
          Something catches Darcy's eye out the driver's side mirror.
          She adjusts it. In the distance, ODD GLOWING CLOUDS form in
          the skies over the Northeastern end of the desert.

                         DARCY
          Jane?
          Jane SHUSHES her, leafs through her notes. The bottle of
          champagne begins to vibrate.

                         JANE
          There's got to be some new
          variable... Or an equipment
          malfunction...
          The lights and equipment in the SUV begin to FLICKER around
          them. The computer monitors SQUELCH with static.

                         DARCY
          I don't think there's anything
          wrong with your equipment...
          The champagne bottle starts to RATTLE noisily now as it
          shakes more violently. Jane and Selvig notice.
                         
          
          They watch it curiously, pressure building up inside it, when
          the cork EXPLODES out of it. Champagne goes spewing
          everywhere -- over equipment, over Jane.

          DARCY (CONT'D)
          Jane?

                         JANE
          What?!

                         DARCY
          I think you want to see this.
          Darcy points out the window. Jane and Selvig look out. Over
          the desert --

          MASSIVE CLOUDS OF RAINBOW LIGHT
          Churn in the sky. The three stare, dumbfounded.

                         JANE
          Holy. Shatner.

                         SELVIG
          That's your "subtle" aurora?!

                         JANE
          No-- yes! Let's go!

           EXT. DESERT - MOMENTS LATER 

          The roof panels still open, the SUV races towards the strange
          event, Jane, amazed by the sight, stands with half her body
          out the roof, taking video of the light storm before them.
          The SUV hits a bump. Jane nearly flies out. Selvig grabs
          her, yanks her back in.

           INT. SUV 

          Jane grins, thrilled, pumped with adrenaline.

                         JANE
          Isn't this great?!
          A thought strikes her.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          You're seeing it too, right? I'm
          not crazy?

                         SELVIG
          That's debateable. Put your seat
          belt on!

          The SUV lurches.

           EXT. DESERT 

          Winds HOWL around the SUV now. Up ahead, spiraling down from
          out of the clouds comes --

          AN ENORMOUS TORNADO
          Suffuse with the strange rainbow light, ROARING like a
          thousand freight trains as it touches down.
  
           INT. SUV 

          Selvig looks up through the still-open sunroof at the
          enormous glowing funnel cloud with wonder. Jane clambers
          into the front seat, beside Darcy. She leans way out the
          window, TAPING the storm.

                         JANE
          You've gotta get us closer so I can
          take a magnetic reading.
          Darcy laughs.

                         DARCY
          Yeah, right! Good one!
          (then, realizing)
          Oh God, you're serious...

                         JANE
          You want those college credits or
          not?

           EXT. SUV 

          The SUV tears across a field towards the tornado, Jane
          leaning out the window, taping the event. The SUV disturbs
          two RAVENS perched on a cactus as they race past. The birds
          take flight, when -- KRAKABOOM! A huge BOLT OF LIGHTNING
          strikes down through the center of the funnel cloud before
          them with a terrifying intensity.

           INT. SUV 

          The SUV rocks from the blast. Darcy's had enough. She turns
          the wheel, starts to head away.

                         DARCY
          Keep the credits. I'll intern at
          Burger King.

                         JANE
          What are you doing?!

                         DARCY
          Saving our lives!
          Jane grabs the wheel, jerks it hard the other way. They
          struggle for control, when the headlights fall on --

                         A MAN

          Directly in their path, stumbling through the winds. Darcy
          slams on the brakes, Jane turns the wheel hard to avoid him.
          The SUV swerves -- but too late.

           EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) 

          The side of the SUV slams into the man with a THUD, sending
          him flying. The car SKIDS to a stop.

           INT. SUV 

          Jane, Darcy, and Selvig trade shocked looks, breathing hard.
          They peer through the dust clouds, unable to see through.
          A paralyzed moment, then they all leap out of the car.

           EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) 

          The three race from the SUV with flashlights. Jane spots the
          man lying on the ground. He's dressed in tattered clothing,
          charred and blackened.

                         DARCY
          I think that was legally your
          fault.

                         JANE
          Get the first aid kit.
          Darcy heads back inside the SUV as Jane, concerned, kneels
          next to the man. Selvig hovers, protectively.
          She gently turns his head to the light, and we see him
          clearly for the first time. He is magnificently handsome,
          long blonde hair flowing around his classically sculpted
          features. She cups her hands around his face, as if willing
          the life back into him.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          Come on, big guy. Do me a favor
          and don't be dead, okay? Open your
          eyes and look at me.
          Suddenly, he GROANS, and she's startled, then relieved, as
          his eyes flutter open. She looks deep into his confused,
          azure eyes, which at last focus on her own. Locking onto
          them.
          For a moment, they each forget to breathe.
          The connection is broken as Darcy returns with the kit. She
          freezes when she sees how gorgeous the man is.

                         DARCY
          Wow. Does he need CPR? Because I
          know CPR.
          A flustered Jane smooths her hair and sits back on her heels.
          She looks up at Selvig. Back to being a scientist.

                         JANE

                         HIS EYES--

                         DARCY

                         (DREAMILY)
          --are beautiful.

                         JANE
          --are dilating. That's a good
          sign.

                         SELVIG
          We still have to get him to a
          hospital.

                         JANE

                         (HOPEFULLY)
          After we get a reading on the
          storm?

                         SELVIG
          Immediately, Jane.
          Jane sighs and nods, regretfully watching the storm EVAPORATE
          above their heads. A thought strikes her.

                         JANE
          Where did he come from?
          They exchange puzzled looks, as we move up through the last
          glowing remnants of the storm, and into:

           EXT. SPACE 

          EARTH spins slowly before us as we hear a voice, deep and
          resonant -- the voice of HEIMDALL, Gatekeeper of Asgard.

          HEIMDALL (V.O.)
          Questions, they've always asked
          questions -- this race called man,
          on this planet they call earth.
          Passionately longing to know how
          they are connected to the heavens.

          We pull away from the planet, widening, past other worlds,
          cosmic debris -- leaving first our solar system, then our
          galaxy.

          HEIMDALL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          In ages past, they looked to us as
          gods, for indeed so many times we
          saved them from calamity. We tried
          to show them how their world was
          but one of the Nine Realms of the
          Cosmos, linked to all others by the
          branches of Yggdrasil...
          We pull back until we see it -- YGGDRASIL. Immense,
          sprawling, like a quasar or a nebula twisted into the vague
          shape of a TREE, its branches of glowing energy stretching
          out into the black void of space.

          HEIMDALL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          ...the Worlds Tree. Nine Realms in
          a universe of wonder, beauty, and
          terror that they barely
          comprehended.
          We move in through Yggdrasil, until we reach what looks like
          a galaxy, slowly spinning before us.

          HEIMDALL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          But for all their thirst for
          knowledge, they let our lessons
          fall into myth and dreams.
          Where did he come from? He came
          from us, the proudest race of
          warriors the Worlds have ever seen.
          He came from this -- the greatest
          Realm the universe has ever known.
          We move through the galaxy's mists and astral matter, then
          over and up, through a band of prismatic color to reveal
          what's on the other side:

          HEIMDALL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          He came... from Asgard!

           EXT. ASGARD - DAY 

          Beautiful beyond imagination. We fly over the magnificent
          landscape of the Realm, through the gleaming capital city,
          modern yet timeless.

           EXT. ODIN'S PALACE - DAY 

          The palace rises countless stories tall, gleaming with an
          other-worldly majesty, towering high above the Realm sprawled
          out before it.
          We move towards a large window of the palace, where a FIGURE

                         STANDS --

                         ODIN ALLFATHER
          Stares out at his kingdom. The ravens fly up to the balcony,
          land at his side.

           INT. ODIN'S CHAMBERS - DAY 

          Odin turns away from the window. His wife FRIGGA sits at a
          vanity and tries different earrings before the mirror.

                         ODIN
          Do you think he's ready?

                         FRIGGA
          He thinks he is. He has his
          father's confidence.

                         ODIN
          He'll need his father's wisdom.

                         FRIGGA
          And his humility?
          Odin reacts.

          FRIGGA (CONT'D)
          Thor won't be alone. Loki will be
          at his side to give him counsel.
          Have faith in your sons.

                         ODIN
          Yes, but Thor's still a boy. He
          could be a great King...
          Odin stops, notices HIS HAND SHAKING. It seems to be out of
          synch temporally with the rest of the world, leaving a trail
          as it moves. He stares at it determinedly, concentrating,
          trying to stop the strange event through the force of his
          sheer will.

          Finally, the occurrence subsides, his hand normal once more.
          A worried Frigga covers his hand with her own.

          ODIN (CONT'D)

                         (QUIETLY)
          ...if we only had more time.

                         FRIGGA
          For once, our son needs something
          we cannot provide.

                         ODIN
          I can fight it a little longer...

                         FRIGGA
          No. You've put it off too long! I
          worry for you.
          He touches her cheek.

                         ODIN
          I've destroyed demons and monsters,
          devastated whole worlds, laid waste
          to mighty kingdoms, and still you
          worry for me?

                         FRIGGA
          Always.

                         ODIN
          Not today. Now come kiss your
          king... while I'm still king.
          He pulls her close, and they kiss.

           INT. PALACE ANTEROOM - DAY 

          Directly under the throne room, a gloomily lit hall. Banners
          hang on either side to form a corridor down the middle of the
          fire lit room.
          Giant doors open at one end. A huge figure silhouetted
          against the bright light beyond walks forward. In slo-mo, we
          recognize the unmistakable shape of the God of Thunder.
          Hammer in hand, he reaches the end of a raised platform.
          An ATTENDANT hands the figure a goblet of wine.
          He downs it quickly, hurls it towards the fire directly
          below.

                         THOR
          Another!

          The cup smashes, the alcohol causes the fire to glow
          intensely -- and, for a moment, brightly lit, and seen full
          length, like a King to be, is THE MIGHTY THOR.
          He proceeds down stops, past camera, and down the center of
          the Hall.
          We follow from behind and see at the other end, massively
          shadowed on one of the great banners, the shape of two great
          horns. As Thor approaches, the horn shapes move, and then,
          from the shadows at the side, emerges LOKI, wearing his
          horned headpiece.
          Like Thor, he is dressed for a great ceremony. They stand by
          a brazier at the foot of steps that lead up to the crowded
          throne room.

                         LOKI

                         (TO THOR)
          Nervous, brother?

                         THOR
          Have you ever known me to be
          nervous?

                         LOKI
          There was the time in Nornheim...

                         THOR
          That wasn't nerves, brother. It
          was the rage of battle. How else
          could I have fought my way through
          a hundred warriors and pulled us
          out alive?
          The Attendant approaches with another goblet of wine for
          Thor.

                         LOKI
          As I recall, I was the one who
          veiled us in smoke to ease our
          escape.

                         THOR
          Some do battle, others just do
          tricks.
          The Attendant stifles a laugh. Loki notices, doesn't like
          it. He gestures towards the goblet in the Attendant's hand.
          EELS pour over the sides of the goblet, slithering out and
          across the terrified Attendant's hand. He SCREAMS, hurls the
          goblet to the ground. Loki chuckles.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          Loki...
          Loki gestures to the writhing eels on the ground. They turn
          back to spilled wine, the illusion shattered.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          Now that was just a waste of good
          wine.

                         LOKI
          Just a bit of fun.
          (to the Attendant)
          Right, my friend?
          The Attendant isn't so sure. Thor dons his EAGLE-WINGED

          HELMET.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          (re: Thor's helmet)
          Nice feathers.

                         THOR
          You don't really want to start this
          again, do you, Cow?

                         LOKI
          I was being sincere!

                         THOR
          You're incapable of sincerity.

                         LOKI
          Am I?
          He looks his brother in the eye, all pretense lost.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          I've looked forward to this day as
          long as you have. You're my
          brother and my friend. Sometimes
          I'm envious, but never doubt that I
          love you.
  
           .
          Thor searches his brother's face, sees no trace of irony.
          He's either speaking from his heart or he's a very, very good
          liar. Maybe both. Thor puts an appreciative hand on his
          brother's shoulder.

                         THOR
          Thank you.
          The two brothers take in the moment a beat, then:

                         LOKI
          Give us a kiss.

                         THOR
          Stop.
          Thor makes the final adjustments to his ceremonial wear.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          How do I look?

                         LOKI
          Like a king.
          They hear the blast of a CEREMONIAL HORN.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          It's time.

                         THOR
          You go ahead.
          Loki casts him a wary look.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          I'll be along. Go on.
          Loki heads inside the palace without his brother.

          A INT. ANTECHAMBER - NIGHT A

          VOLSTAGG combs his great beard in preparation for the big
          event. As he does, he's surprised to find a stray GRAPE
          stuck in the beard. He pulls it out, looks around, then
          eagerly pops it into his mouth and gobbles it down.
          FANDRAL checks his reflection in a mirror, smooths out his
          moustache, gives himself a dashing smile. A PRETTY MAIDEN
          holds the mirror before him, as other MAIDENS look on
          dreamily.

                         FANDRAL
          Thank you, love.
          (to the Maidens)

                         (MORE)

                         FANDRAL (CONT'D)
          Now who'd like to polish my sword
          for me?
          The giddy Maidens eagerly raise their hands.
          HOGUN stands staring ahead grimly, his hands folded in front
          of him, amidst the hustle and bustle of the ATTENDANTS and
          the ceremony preparations going on around him. A HELPFUL
          ATTENDANT approaches him and starts to polish his armor.
          Hogun turns his head, gives him a look. Intimidated, the
          Attendant quickly backs away.
          From behind, we see a WOMAN IN CEREMONIAL ARMOR take off her
          SWORD and set it on a table, then her SHIELD, then several
          HIDDEN DAGGERS and small, yet intimidating WEAPONS. We
          reveal that it's SIF, looking radiant. She eyes the weapons
          on the table.

                         SIF
          (to the weapons)
          I'll miss you.

           INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY 

          Colorful CEREMONIAL BANNERS of the Nine Realms adorn the
          room, crowded with AESIR and REPRESENTATIVES from across
          Yggdrasil, all BUZZING with excitement.
          Thor's COMRADES enter and stride to their place of honor at
          the front of the hall. They are:

          THE WARRIORS THREE
          VOLSTAGG has the girth and strength of a Sumo wrestler, with
          oversized passions to match. FANDRAL, the consummate
          swashbuckler, is agile, charismatic, and nattily dressed.
          HOGUN -- dark, sullen, brooding -- a large MACE slung at his
          side.
          With them walks the warrior maiden SIF. She's clad in armor,
          a shield and sword at her side -- a beauty not to be trifled
          with.

                         
                         VOLSTAGG
          I hope this goes quickly. I'm
          famished.

                         FANDRAL

                         (FEIGNED DISBELIEF)
          Noooo!

                         VOLSTAGG
          Are you attached to that pretty
          face of yours? Because one more
          word, and you won't be.

                         FANDRAL
          (to the others)
          My, we are hungry, aren't we?
          The others laugh, save Hogun. Fandral turns to him.

          FANDRAL (CONT'D)
          Go on, Hogun. Smile. You can do
          it. Even you, Hogun the Grim.
          Just one smile.
          Hogun stares at him grimly.

          FANDRAL (CONT'D)
          All right, half a smile. Look,
          forget the smile, just show some
          teeth.

                         SIF
          Fandral, is it true the famous
          Warriors Three are ready to meet
          any challenge?

                         FANDRAL
          Name it, Lady Sif.

                         SIF
          Keep your mouth shut.

           INT. VAULT - DAY 

          Imposing EINHERJAR GUARDS clad in armor, swords at the ready,
          stand watch inside the massive underground structure beneath
          the palace.
          A cold BREEZE blows past them.

          A INT. PALACE ANTEROOM - DAY A

          Thor stands, his fingers nervously drumming the handle of his
          hammer. Frigga approaches behind him, sees his anxiety.

                         FRIGGA
          It's all right to be nervous.

                         THOR
          Why does everyone keep saying that?
          I'm not nervous!

                         FRIGGA
          You may be able to fool the rest of

                         ASGARD --

                         THOR
          ...but never you. I know.

                         FRIGGA
          Thor, just remember that you have
          something even the great Allfather
          never had.

                         THOR
          And what is that?

                         FRIGGA
          Me for a mother.
          She smiles.

          FRIGGA (CONT'D)
          Now don't keep your father waiting.
          Frigga leaves.

           INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY 

          Sif and the Warriors Three still wait before the crowd. Loki
          and Frigga enter. Loki takes his place at the front of the
          hall alongside the others. With another blast of the horn,
          the crowd goes silent as the EINHERJAR HONOR GUARD moves into
          formation. They part to reveal --

                         ODIN
          Sitting atop his throne, clad in full ceremonial armor. He
          holds his spear GUNGNIR before him. Any trace of weakness in
          him is gone now. He exudes all the power and majesty of a
          Ruler of Asgard.
          Frigga joins him at his side. He looks around the hall,
          casts a glance over to the Warriors. Thor is nowhere to be
          seen. Odin looks to Loki. Loki shrugs. Odin isn't pleased.
          A murmur spreads through the crowd.

                         VOLSTAGG
          (sotto, to Loki)
          Where is he?

                         LOKI
          He said he'd be along.
          Sif realizes the truth, shakes her head in disapproval.

                         VOLSTAGG
          What?

                         SIF
          He wants to make an entrance.

                         FANDRAL
          Well, if he doesn't show up soon,
          he shouldn't bother. Odin looks
          like he's ready to feed him to his
          ravens.

                         LOKI
          I wouldn't worry. Father will
          forgive him. He always does.

          Just then, at the back of the hall, up the steps from the
          lower level --

                         MJOLNIR
          Roars up into the hall, Thor strides cockily into the hall
          behind it, catching it behind his back. The CROWD erupts in
          CHEERS. Thor spins his hammer with a flourish, holds it up
          before the crowd, basking in the moment, relishing the
          adoration, whipping his audience up into a frenzy.

                         SIF
          Oh, please.
          Odin watches from the front, not liking this showy display.

           INT. VAULT - DAY 

          As the sound of the cheers echo from above, the odd, cold
          breeze picks up in the Vault. The Guards rub their limbs to
          warm themselves. They grow increasingly uneasy, sensing
          something's not right.
          They exchange a look, then walk the length of the Vault's
          hallway to its end, where a CASKET sits undisturbed upon a
          pedestal.
          LARGE SHADOWS suddenly loom over them. They look up and
          SHOUT in terror as they raise their weapons.

           INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY 

          Thor finishes stirring up the crowd, then reaches the front
          of the room, kneels on one knee before his mother and father.
          Frigga casts him an admonishing glance. Thor winks up at
          her. She can't help but smile.
          Odin strikes Gungnir upon the ground with a deafening BOOM.
          The crowd falls silent. Odin speaks with quiet, effortless
          authority.
          He raises Gungnir before him.

                         ODIN
          Gungnir. Its aim is true, its
          power strong. With it I have
          defended Asgard and the lives of
          the innocent across the Nine Realms
          since the time of the Great
          Beginning. And though the day has
          come for a new King to wield his
          own weapon -- that duty remains the
          same. Thor Odinson, my heir, my
          first-born.

                         (MORE)

                         ODIN (CONT'D)
          So long entrusted with this mighty
          hammer, Mjolnir. Forged in the
          heart of a dying star, from the
          sacred metal of Uru. Only one may
          lift it. Only one is worthy. Who
          wields this hammer commands the
          lightning and the storm. Its power
          has no equal -- as a weapon, to
          destroy, or as a tool, to build.
          It is a fit companion for a King.

           INT. VAULT - DAY 

          The bodies of the Guards are flung to the Vault's floor, now
          strewn with ice. We don't see their attackers clearly, just
          catch glimpses of them in the shadows -- but they are large
          and BLUE-SKINNED.
          One of the creatures lifts the Casket off its stand and turns
          to go. But, as they do, the intricate latticework behind the
          Casket starts to separate and retract, revealing something
          standing in the shadows behind it.
          As the creatures walk away, a fiery glow rises behind them.
          They turn back around.
          Now it's their turn to SCREAM.

           INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY 

          The Ceremony continues.

                         ODIN
          Today I entrust you with the
          greatest honor in all the Nine
          Realms. The sacred throne of
          Asgard. I have sacrificed much to
          achieve peace. So, too, must a new
          generation sacrifice to maintain
          that peace. Responsibility, duty,
          honor. These are not merely
          virtues to which we must aspire.
          They are essential to every soldier
          and to every King.
          The Crowd and the Warriors Three start to shiver and rub
          their limbs for warmth in the increasingly cold air of the
          hall.
          Thor turns back to face his father. Odin looks upon his son
          with pride.

          ODIN (CONT'D)
          Thor Odinson, do you swear to guard
          the Nine Realms?

                         THOR
          I swear.

                         ODIN
          Do you swear to preserve the peace?

                         THOR
          I swear.

                         ODIN
          Do you swear to cast aside all
          selfish ambition and pledge
          yourself only to the good of all
          the Realms?
          Beat.

                         THOR
          I swear.

                         ODIN
          Then on this day, I, Odin
          Allfather, proclaim you--
          Odin hesitates, noticing a strange sight before him. ICE
          creeps across the surface of the large banners around the
          hall, making an eerie CRACKING sound. Thor, his comrades,
          and the crowd see it too.

          ODIN (CONT'D)

                         (REALIZING)
          Frost giants...
          The far-off sounds of a BATTLE echo in the depths of the
          palace below. Sif and the Warriors Three reach for their
          weapons, as Thor races from the hall.

         INT. VAULT - DAY

          Thor enters, then stares shocked at the sight before him.
          Sif, the Warriors Three, and Loki hurry in behind Thor and
          stop short.
          Shattered and melting ICE is strewn about the floor.
          We don't see the blue-skinned bodies of the Frost Giants
          clearly, just catch glimpses of their twisted and smoldering
          remains on the floor.
          They've just lost a savage battle. Badly.
          Amidst them, shrouded in shadow, stands the black metal
          creature, a fiery glow coming from within it.
          It is THE DESTROYER. It holds the Casket in its hands.

                         SIF
          The Destroyer.

                         VOLSTAGG

                         (AWED)
          I thought it was but a legend.
          Odin steps in behind the Asgardians, as the Destroyer sets
          the Casket back on its pedestal. It moves back to its post,
          the faint, FIERY GLOW extinguishes within it.
          Fandral looks around the Vault, ill at ease.

                         FANDRAL
          I've never been inside the Vault
          before. It's said the Tesseract
          was once held here.

                         VOLSTAGG

                         (AWED)
          The Tesseract? I thought that was
          but a legend too!

                         SIF
          Shush!
          Odin surveys the destruction.

                         THOR
          The Jotuns must pay for what
          they've done!
		 
                         ODIN
          They have paid with their lives.
          The Destroyer did its job, and the
          Casket is safe. All is well.

                         THOR
          "All is well?!" They broke into
          the Weapons Vault! If the Frost
          Giants had stolen even one of these

                         RELICS--

                         ODIN
          But they didn't.

                         THOR
          I want to know why they--

                         ODIN

                         (INTERRUPTING)
          The Casket of Ancient Winters
          belonged to the Jotuns. They
          believe it's their birthright.

                         THOR
          And if you hadn't taken it from
          them they would have laid waste to
          all the Nine Realms!

                         ODIN
          I have a truce with Laufey, the
          Jotun King.

                         THOR
          He just broke your truce! We must
          act!
          Odin turns to Sif and the Warriors Three.

                         ODIN
          Leave us.
          Thor's comrades exit. Odin eyes Thor, as Loki watches.

          ODIN (CONT'D)
          And what action would you take?

                         THOR
          March into Jotunheim as you once
          did, teach them a lesson, break
          their spirits so they'll never dare
          try to cross our borders again!

                         ODIN
          You're thinking only as a warrior!

                         THOR
          This was an act of war!

                         ODIN
          It was the act of but a few, doomed
          to fail.

                         THOR
          They got this far!

                         ODIN
          We will find the breach in our
          defenses. It will be found, and it
          will be sealed.

                         THOR
          As King of Asgard, I would--

                         ODIN
          You are not King. Not yet.
          Thor sees in his father's face that he's pushed this as far
          as he can. He backs away, then leaves, pushing through the
          doors so hard that they SLAM backwards behind him. Odin
          watches him go.

           INT. BANQUET HALL - DAY 

          Thor stands in the empty hall, bearing the signs of the
          festivities cancelled due to the events of the day. Anger
          and frustration rising within him, Thor upends one of the
          massive tables.
          From across the room, Loki watches him.

          AT THE BANQUET HALL ENTRANCE
          Sif, Fandral, and Hogun follow Volstagg as he enters in
          search of his dinner.

                         SIF
          Redecorating, are we?
          Volstagg surveys the overturned tables and food, aghast.

                         VOLSTAGG
          What's this -- ?!

                         HOGUN
          I told you they'd cancel it.

                         FANDRAL
          We thought that was just you being
          your normal cheery self.
          Volstagg looks about the floor, despairing.

                         VOLSTAGG
          All this food -- so innocent, cast
          to the ground. It breaks the
          heart!
          Thor strides away from them to the far end of the hall. Loki
          calmly moves towards him.

                         THOR
          It's unwise to be in my company
          right now, brother.

                         LOKI
          Who said I was wise?

                         THOR
          (re: the empty hall)
          This was to be my day of triumph.

                         LOKI
          It will come. In time.

                         (ADMITS)
          If it's any consolation, I think
          you're right. About the Frost
          Giants, about Laufey, everything.
          If a few of them could penetrate
          the defenses of Asgard once, who's
          to say they won't try again. Next
          time with an army?

                         THOR
          Yes, exactly!

                         LOKI
          But there's nothing we can do
          without defying Father.
          Thor considers this, looks at his hammer, a gleam in his eye.
          Loki can guess what he's thinking, grows concerned.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          No... stop there! I know that
          look!

                         THOR
          It's the only way to ensure the
          safety of our borders.

                         LOKI
          It's madness!

                         VOLSTAGG
          Madness? What sort of madness?

                         LOKI
          Nothing! Thor was making a jest!

                         THOR
          The safety of our Realm is no jest.
          We're going to Jotunheim.

                          FANDRAL
          What?!

                          SIF
          Thor, of all the laws of Asgard,
          this is one you must not break.
          Loki looks on, intrigued by the proceedings.

                         FANDRAL
          This isn't like a journey to Earth,
          where you summon a little lightning
          and thunder and the mortals worship
          you as a god. This is Jotunheim.

                         VOLSTAGG
          And if the Frost Giants don't kill
          you, your Father will!

                         THOR
          My father fought his way into
          Jotunheim, defeated their armies,
          and took their Casket! We'd just
          be looking for answers.

                         SIF
          It is forbidden!
          Thor sizes up his friends, smiles. He proceeds to make his
          case with enthusiasm and charismatic conviction.

                         THOR
          My friends, have you forgotten all
          that we've done together?
          He turns to Fandral.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          Who brought you into the sweet
          embrace of the most exotic maidens
          in all of Yggdrasil?

                         FANDRAL
          You did.

                         THOR

                         (TO HOGUN)
          Who led you into the most glorious
          of battles...

                         (TO VOLSTAGG)
          ...and to delicacies so succulent,
          you thought you'd died and gone to
          Valhalla?

                         VOLSTAGG/HOGUN
          You did. / You did.
          He turns to Sif.

                         THOR
          And who proved wrong all who
          scoffed at the idea that a young
          maiden could be one of the fiercest
          warriors this Realm has ever known?

                         SIF
          I did.

                         THOR

                         (QUICKLY)
          True. But I supported you...
          (then, to the others)
          My friends, trust me now. We must
          do this.
          The others exchange concerned looks, realize there's no
          convincing him.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          Come on. You're not going to let
          my brother and me take all the
          glory, are you?
          Loki looks startled.

                         LOKI
          What?

                         THOR
          You are coming with me...

                         LOKI
          Yes, of course! I won't let my
          brother march into Jotunheim alone.
          I will be at his side.

                         VOLSTAGG
          And I.

                         FANDRAL
          And I.

                         HOGUN
          And I. The Warriors Three fight
          together.

                         SIF
          I fear we'll live to regret this.

                         VOLSTAGG
          If we're lucky.

           EXT. ODIN'S PALACE - DAY 

          Thor, Sif, Loki, and the Warriors Three walk from the Palace,
          across the grounds. They reach a group of ATTENDANTS who
          ready their battle gear for their journey.
          Loki slips away from the group, speaks to a nearby GUARD.
          Hogun notices.

                         THOR
          We must first find a way to get
          past Heimdall.

                         VOLSTAGG
          That will be no easy task. It's
          said the Gatekeeper can see a
          single dew drop fall from a blade
          of grass a thousand worlds away.

                         FANDRAL
          And he can hear a cricket passing
          gas in Niffelheim.

                         VOLSTAGG
          Jest not! He heareth all!

                         FANDRAL
          Please. Getting past him should be
          simple enough now, since he seems
          to be letting Frost Giants sneak by
          under his nose.
          Volstagg, terrified, calls out to the sky.

                         VOLSTAGG
          Forgive him! He meaneth no
          offense!
          Loki rejoins the group as Thor leads them onward.

           EXT. GATE OF ASGARD - DAY 

          Thor and his band of adventurers, on horseback, pass through
          the massive Gate, leaving Asgard behind. They ride along the
          most astounding path in this Realm or any other --

          THE RAINBOW BRIDGE.
          Wide and flat, it runs straight out from Odin's palace to the
          mists and black void of space beyond. In the distance far
          ahead, the Bridge continues on until it reaches Heimdall's
          Observatory.

           EXT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY - DAY 

          The band draws near the Observatory, where HEIMDALL himself,
          Gatekeeper of Asgard, stands at his post on the Bridge before
          them, blocking their way, staring them down.
          There is something other-worldly about him, even for this
          Realm. He holds a massive sword in front of him, his stern,
          intimidating face virtually concealed by armor. Something
          glints beneath his visor, like twinkling stars.

                         LOKI
          Keep your weapons sheathed and your
          mouths closed. This is going to
          take subtlety and sincerity, not
          brute strength. Leave it to me.
          Loki dismounts and steps forward.

          LOKI (CONT'D)

                         GOOD HEIMDALL--

                         HEIMDALL
          You're not dressed warmly enough.
          Thor, Loki, and the others trade looks.

                         LOKI
          I'm sorry?

                         HEIMDALL
          The freezing cold of Jotunheim. It
          will kill you all in time, even
          Thor.

                         (THEN)
          You think you can deceive me? I,
          who watch all? I, who can sense
          the flapping of a butterfly's wings
          a thousand worlds away?
          He fixes his eyes pointedly at Fandral.

          HEIMDALL (CONT'D)
          Or can hear a cricket passing gas
          in Niffelheim?
          Fandral looks gob-smacked.

                         FANDRAL
          That was just a bit of a jest,
          really...
          Loki goes into damage control.

                         LOKI
          You must be mistaken. We're not--

                         THOR

                         (STEPPING FORWARD)
          Enough.

                         (TO HEIMDALL)
          Heimdall, may we pass?
          Heimdall stares him down.

                         HEIMDALL
          For ages have I guarded Asgard and
          kept it safe from those who would
          do it harm. In all that time,
          never has an enemy slipped by my
          watch -- until this day. I wish to
          know how that happened.

                         THOR
          Then tell no one where we've gone
          until we've returned.
          Thor walks past Heimdall as the Gatekeeper lets the group
          pass. Volstagg walks beside the frustrated Loki, needles
          him.

                         VOLSTAGG
          What happened? Your silver tongue
          turn to lead?

                         LOKI
          Get me off this bridge before it
          cracks under your girth.
          Volstagg and Fandral share a laugh.

           INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY - DAY 

          Thor and the others enter the Observatory, step onto a
          platform. Heimdall climbs into the large control apparatus
          at the center of the room and readies the Observatory.

                         HEIMDALL
          Be warned. I will honor my sworn
          oath to protect this Realm as its
          Gatekeeper. If your return
          threatens the safety of Asgard,
          Bifrost will remain closed to you.
          You'll be left to die in the cold
          wastes of Jotunheim.

                         THOR
          I have no plans to die today.

                         HEIMDALL
          None do.
          Heimdall inserts his sword into the control panel, and the
          apparatus of the Observatory starts up.

           EXT. RAINBOW BRIDGE 

          The Bifrost energy quickens along the Bridge, feeding into
          the Observatory.

           INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY 

          Heimdall turns his sword in the control panel. The
          Observatory's giant turret swings around, aims toward a
          section of space. As a final step, Heimdall plunges his
          sword deeper into the control panel. The great turret FIRES,
          the RAINBOW LIGHT of Bifrost energy blasts out of it.
          The Bifrost opens at the end of the platform upon which Thor
          and his five comrades stand.

                         HEIMDALL
          All is ready. You may pass.

                         VOLSTAGG
          Couldn't you just leave the bridge
          open for us?

                         HEIMDALL
          To keep this bridge open would
          unleash the full power of the
          Bifrost and destroy Jotunheim with
          you upon it.

                         VOLSTAGG
          Ah. Never mind, then.
          Thor starts towards the Bifrost, turns back to the others,
          grins.

                         THOR
          Come on. Don't be bashful.
          The others join him at his side, then step towards the
          Bifrost. Their bodies stretch towards the maelstrom,
          changing shape, as if every atom of their being is being
          elongated by the pull of it. In an instant, they're jerked
          off the platform and inside the vortex.

           EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (JOTUNHEIM) - DAY 

          A hole in the sky rips open, and the Bifrost comes shooting
          out of it. Snow flurries up when the Bifrost hits, as Thor
          and his band touch down. RUNES from the Bifrost are
          imprinted on the ice around them.

          Volstagg loses his footing, falling backwards. Thor quickly
          grabs him by the belt. We see the warrior dangling
          precariously on the edge of a sheer cliff on the planet's
          inner ring, opening up to the black abyss of space beyond.

                         THOR
          Come on, big fella. Up...!
          With an effort, Thor pulls the burly warrior back onto the
          ice and, tremendously relieved, he proclaims:

                         VOLSTAGG
          This belt! This belt is now my
          lucky belt! I will never remove
          it! Even when bathing!

                         FANDRAL
          You bathe?
          Thor and the others turn and stare out in horror and wonder
          at the frozen alien wasteland before them. The whole planet
          is a massive flattened ring of jagged ice, slowly breaking
          apart. Huge CHUNKS OF ICE calve away from its outer edges
          and float off into space. The planet's icy surface cracks
          and melts as far as the eye can see. The ruins of a Jotun
          city lies in the distance.

                         HOGUN
          We shouldn't be here.

                         THOR
          Too late now.

                         FANDRAL
          Actually, it's not. We could turn
          right around, hop back to Asgard,
          share a mug by the fire. Could be
          nice.
          Thor ignore him, heads off. Loki looks around, anxious.

                         LOKI
          Perhaps we should wait.
          Thor turns back to his brother.

                         THOR
          For what?

                         LOKI
          To survey the enemy. To gauge
          their strengths and weaknesses from
          a distance.

                         VOLSTAGG
          I'm liking that. Gauging,
          surveying. Particularly the
          distance part.

                         THOR
          We know all we must. It's time to
          act.
          Thor heads on. Reluctantly, the others follow.

                         SIF
          He's just got to swing his
          hammer...

           EXT. JOTUNHEIM - DAY 

          The group trudges behind Thor across the frozen wasteland,
          shielding themselves from the howling wind and cold. Loki
          looks around them, anxious. Volstagg shivers.
          Thor, invigorated, turns back to his comrades.

                         THOR
          It feels good, doesn't it? To be
          together again, adventuring on
          another world?

                         FANDRAL
          Adventuring? Is that what we're
          doing?

                         THOR
          What would you call it?

                         FANDRAL
          Freezing.

                         VOLSTAGG
          Starving.

                         SIF
          Whining.

                         THOR
          How about a song to lift our
          spirits?
          The others groan.

                         HOGUN
          No, not that!

                         SIF
          Please don't make us sing again!

                         FANDRAL
          If I have to listen to Volstagg's
          singing voice one more time, I'll
          fall on my own sword!

                         SIF
          Well, now I'm on board.
          She and Thor share a grin.
          The party reaches the edge of the city -- its ancient
          structures of jade and ice melting and crumbling, ravaged by
          warfare long ago. A TEMPLE lies before them, across a
          central plaza.

          SIF (CONT'D)
          Where are they?

                         THOR
          Hiding. As cowards always do.
          Thor leads the others onwards towards the central plaza.
          Loki reluctantly follows. They don't notice as SHADOWY
          FIGURES move in the shadows of the structures nearby.

           EXT. CENTRAL PLAZA - DAY 

          The party reaches the plaza. They sense the Frost Giants in
          the shadows and crevices, surrounding them now on all sides.
          The Asgardians reach for the hilts of their weapons.
          A JOTUN SENTRY calls to him.

                         JOTUN SENTRY
          What is your business here,
          Asgardian?
          The Jotun's voice itself sounds like cracking ice.

                         THOR
          I speak only to your King. Not to
          his foot soldiers.

          JOTUN VOICE (O.S.)
          Then speak.
          Thor turns towards the source in a balcony of the temple,
          where LAUFEY sits, veiled in shadow, behind a cascading
          waterfall. The Jotun King is ancient, noble, powerful -- too
          proud to reveal even a hint of the years of suffering he and
          his people have endured.

                         LAUFEY
          I am Laufey, King of this Realm.

                         THOR
          And I am--

                         LAUFEY
          We know who you are, Odinson. Why
          have you brought the stench of your
          blood into my world?

                         THOR
          I demand answers.
          Laufey stands, sizing up Thor, tries to piece this together.

                         LAUFEY
          You "demand?"

                         THOR
          How did your people get into
          Asgard?

                         LAUFEY
          The house of Odin is full of
          traitors.
          Sif and the Warriors Three exchange a puzzled look, disturbed
          by the Jotun King's words.

                         THOR
          Do not dishonor my father's name
          with your lies.

                         LAUFEY
          Your father is a murderer and a
          thief. He stole what was ours, and
          left our world in ruins. We have
          the right to reclaim the Casket.

                         THOR
          Not when you'd use it to make war
          against other Realms.
          Laufey laughs, cold, mocking.

                         LAUFEY
          And why have you come here? To
          make peace? You long for battle.
          You crave it. I see you for what
          you are, Thor Odinson. Nothing but
          a boy, trying to prove himself a
          man.

                         THOR
          This boy has grown tired of your
          mockery.
          Thor takes a step towards Laufey. The other Jotuns step in
          front of Thor, blocking his path. We finally see the Frost
          Giants now -- terrifying, blue-skinned, standing eight feet
          tall. Loki moves next to his brother and quietly implores
          him.

                         LOKI
          Thor, stop and think. Look around
          you. We are outnumbered.

                         THOR
          Know your place, brother...

                         LAUFEY
          You should listen to his counsel.
          You know not what your actions
          would unleash.
          Laufey steps out of the shadows.

          LAUFEY (CONT'D)
          But I do. Go now, while I still
          allow it.
          Thor simmers. Loki speaks up.

                         LOKI
          We will accept your most gracious
          offer.
          The others look to Thor imploringly. Thor stares Laufey down
          a beat -- then relents. He turns to leave. His comrades
          breathe a sigh of relief and follow, when a Frost Giant
          nearby mutters under his breath.
		  
                         JOTUN
          Run back home, little princess.
          Thor stops in his tracks. Loki goes white. He knows what's
          coming.

                         LOKI
          Damn.
          In one quick move, Thor pulls Mjolnir, swings it, and KNOCKS
          the Jotun clear across the plaza. The Asgardians reluctantly
          draw their weapons, gather into a circle around Thor.
          Volstagg looks around at the angry Jotuns approaching them.

                         VOLSTAGG
          Silly hammer! Has a mind of its
          own!
          ICE forms on the Jotuns' bodies, creating a FROZEN ARMOR
          around them, extending off the ends of their arms like
          SWORDS. One Giant does so directly in front of Fandral.

                         FANDRAL
          I'm hoping that's just decorative.
          Thor leaves the circle of Asgardians, swings at another Frost
          Giant. His comrades form another circle around him,
          separating him from the Jotuns, as he whirls his hammer
          around once and catches it with a cocky grin. He's enjoying
          this.

                         THOR
          Next!
          Fandral calls to Volstagg and Hogun.

                         FANDRAL
          Well? What move, do you think?

                         VOLSTAGG
          I say we use "The Norn's Revenge."

                         FANDRAL
          At this close range? I think "The
          Alfheim Lunge" is a better move.

                         VOLSTAGG

                         (DISGUSTED)
          Maybe if they were three feet tall!
          No! How about "The Randy
          Valkyrie"?

                         HOGUN
          Shut up!
          Thor takes out yet another Frost Giant, then all hell breaks
          loose as the Asgardians and Jotuns begin to battle.
          A Jotun backs Hogun up against a wall of ice. As the Giant
          hurls an ice blade fist at him, the grim warrior swings his
          mace over his head, embedding it into the ice wall, and
          hoists himself up, dodging the Giant's blow and leaping over
          him. Hogun takes out a second approaching Frost Giant, spins
          back, dodges a swing from the first, then pounds the Jotun
          with his mace.
          Nearby, Sif expertly stabs one Jotun after another with her
          double-bladed staff. One knocks her viciously to the ground.

                         SIF
          If you don't treat me like a lady,
          I won't act like a lady!
          She takes out the Jotun.
          Loki backs away from an approaching Jotun, finds himself at
          the edge of a deep crevasse. The Giant sees he's vulnerable,
          swipes at him. But the Jotun's arm passes right through him.
          The Giant stands there, confused, when THE REAL LOKI comes
          out from behind a structure and shoves the Giant into the
          crevasse below. The false Loki dissipates into nothingness.

                         LOKI
          (to the falling Giant)
          Pathetic.
          He turns back to the battle. Two Jotuns come at him from
          either side. He lets two daggers fly, felling both Giants at
          once.
          Laufey nods to one of his guards -- a massive Jotun BRUTE.
          The Brute leaps down from the balcony, icing himself up, then
          punches his giant fist into the ice beneath his feet. It's a
          long-range attack, causing PILLARS OF ICE to explode out in
          front of Hogun, sending the grim warrior flying back.
          Across the plaza, Thor easily dispatches some Jotuns.

                         THOR
          Come on! At least make it a
          challenge for me!
          He sees the Brute coming at him. The huge Jotun lands a
          tremendous blow, sending Thor back across the ice. Thor
          rises, grins.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          Now that's more like it!
          He throws Mjolnir with all his strength, knocking the Brute
          head over heels.
          Thor raises his hand. Mjolnir slows in mid-air, then flies
          back to his grasp.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          (re: the fallen Brute)
          Ugly and stupid.
          Sif takes out a couple Frost Giants, but she's knocked to the
          ground by another. It raises its weapon above her.
          Hogun sees Sif in danger. He pulls a HIDDEN KNIFE from his
          sleeve and hurls it at Sif's attacker, hitting him square in
          the chest. The Jotun falls dead.

                         SIF
          (to Hogun, re: knife)
          I'm so glad I taught him how to do
          that!
          Volstagg grapples with a Frost Giant, getting a couple good
          hits in.

                         VOLSTAGG
          You may want to put some ice on
          that!
          The Frost Giant fights back, but Volstagg manages to grip in
          a headlock just as another comes up on him from behind.
          Volstagg fends him off, then turns the first one loose.

          VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)
          You may be taller, but I'm wider!
          Volstagg launches his mighty belly at the Jotun and sends him
          flying.
          Another Jotun grabs Volstagg, squeezing him tightly and
          sending him crashing to the ground.

          VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)
          It's not too late for you to
          surrender.
          Volstagg recovers and fights on. The Jotun grabs Volstagg's
          bare arm. The warrior's skin begins to freeze from the
          Jotun's grasp, a BLACKNESS spreading from it, necrotizing
          Volstagg's flesh. The warrior SHOUTS in pain.

          Volstagg head-butts the Frost Giant, shattering the Jotun's
          ice helmet and dropping him to the ground.
          Winded, he takes a seat upon one of the fallen Jotun's bodies
          to catch his breath. As the battle rages around him, he
          opens a secret compartment at the end of his weapon, takes
          out a small FLASK.
          Volstagg grimaces in pain, sees his blackened skin. He yells
          to his comrades.

          VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)
          Don't let them grab hold of you!
          He takes a swig, enjoying the brief respite, then rejoins the
          battle.
          Volstagg stabs his blade in a Giant's chest, but the sword
          stops mid ice layer.
          The Giant delivers a bone-breaking blow to Volstagg's face,
          and the warrior drops to one knee.
          Sif sees Volstagg in trouble and rushes towards him. In one
          quick move, she leaps up and off of Volstagg's back, using
          her boot to plunge Volstagg's blade deep into the Giant's
          chest, standing atop him as he falls backwards to the ground.

          VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)
          (on his belly)
          Thank you, my lady. But I nearly
          had him!

                         SIF
          Of course you did.
          Nearby, a Frost Giant forms a BARRAGE OF ICE BULLETS, hurling
          them at Sif. Sif raises her shield barely in time, as the
          bullets go pinging and ricocheting off it. She races into
          the group of Frost Giants who attacked her and takes them
          out.

          A Frost Giant touches a pool of standing water. It FLASH-
          FREEZES Hogun's feet to the ground.
          Volstagg notices, hurries over, dispatching Jotuns as he
          goes.

                         VOLSTAGG
          Hang on!
          Volstagg swings his weapon, wildly hacking at the ice around
          Hogun's legs to free him. Hogun looks down, suddenly
          worried, as Volstagg's blade cuts deep -- and perilously
          close to hacking into Hogun's legs.

                         HOGUN
          Watch the legs!

                         VOLSTAGG

                         (REALIZING)
          Right. Sorry.
          Volstagg chips away at the ice more carefully, finally
          freeing Hogun's feet.
          Fandral sword fights with a Frost Giant.

                         FANDRAL
          You really think your icicles are a
          match for Asgardian steel?
          Fandral lunges at the Giant. The Jotun knocks his blade
          away.

          FANDRAL (CONT'D)
          Fair enough.
          Fandral moves on him again, but the Giant grabs Fandral's
          sword and snaps it in half.

          FANDRAL (CONT'D)
          Could we stop just a moment while I
          get another sword?
          Fandral fights the Giant with his broken sword. The Jotun
          then lunges at Fandral, who ducks just in time, grabs hold of
          the Giant's sword and redirects it, stabbing the Giant
          through with his own weapon.
          The Jotun staggers back, then reaches down and swipes at a
          pool of water, sending up a spray that freezes in mid-air,
          forming into an ICE STALAGMITE. It impales Fandral,
          rendering him helpless.

          Loki races towards the impaled Fandral, throwing daggers and
          felling Frost Giants as he goes. He reaches the nearly-
          unconscious warrior, when other Jotuns approach. He fights
          them off.
          Volstagg looks across the plaza and sees the impaled Fandral.

                         VOLSTAGG
          That's unfortunate.
          He hurries to his wounded comrade.

                         FANDRAL
          I may need a bit of help. Not a
          good look, is it?

                         VOLSTAGG
          Just try not to bleed.

                         FANDRAL
          How's the face?

                         VOLSTAGG
          Flawless.
          Volstagg begins to pull the bleeding Fandral off the ice
          stalagmite.
          Loki plunges two daggers into the chest of one of the Frost
          Giants.
          The Giant grabs hold of Loki's gloved wrists. Loki pulls his
          hands free of the gloves, which are still in the Giant's
          grasp, revealing Loki's skin beneath. The wounded Jotun sees
          his chance, grabs hold of Loki's bare arm.
          Loki looks at his arm, prepared for the worst. But instead
          of the blackness of necrotizing flesh, Loki's arm turns BLUE
          -- like the Frost Giant's own skin. The blueness spreads
          painlessly up Loki's arm. He stares at it, confused.
          The Frost Giant is thrown as well, distracted by the
          unexpected phenomenon. Loki takes advantage of the
          distraction, KICKS the Giant.

 .
          Thor continues fighting, his blood lust rising. He taunts
          the Jotuns around him.

                         THOR
          Come on!
          But when he hurls his hammer to take out a Jotun, the Frost
          Giants seize the opportunity. A group of Jotuns swarm Thor
          from all sides, keeping him separate from his weapon.
          Mjolnir falls to the ground.
          A Frost Giant desperately struggles to lift Mjolnir off the
          ground, to no avail.
          Now free, the wounded Fandral looks relieved as Volstagg
          slings him over his shoulder, and the warriors start to
          leave.
          From his balcony, Laufey looks upon the battlefield, decides
          it's time to pull out the big guns. He touches a wall of the
          palace. An ENERGY WAVE sweeps from his touch, across the
          wall of the palace, and down to the ground below.
          The Asgardians hear a foreboding CRACK OF ICE below their
          feet.

                         LOKI
          That can't be good.

                         VOLSTAGG
          Yes, it could! Might be an early
          spring!
          They look down, suddenly filled with dread when they see
          shadowy figures moving in the ice -- dozens of JOTUN WARRIORS
          awakening beneath the surface, rousing to join the battle.
          Loki turns to his brother, who battles a group of the Giants.



                         LOKI
          Thor, we must go!
          Thor, still without his hammer, fights his Jotun foes
          mercilessly, a man consumed by blood lust. Loki sees the
          look on his brother's face -- the savage thrill of the heat
          of battle.

                         THOR
          Then go!

                         SIF
          There are too many of them!

                         THOR
          I can stop them!
          The others hesitate. Jotuns break up through the ice all
          around them.

                         SIF
          Thor!
          But Thor ignores his comrades, continues fighting.

                         VOLSTAGG
          Run!
          Reluctantly, the group flees back toward the inner edge of
          the planet as the Giants break up through the ice and give
          chase.
          Thor battles valiantly, but there's just too many of them.
          The Frost Giants swarm him from all sides now, as he
          disappears beneath a pile of blue flesh and ice. After a

                         MOMENT --

          THOR'S FIST
          Forces its way up through the middle of the pile of Jotuns.
          He opens his hand, beckoning.
          One of Thor's attackers hears something ROARING up behind
          him. He whirls around -- BAM! -- Mjolnir nails him square in
          the face, then flies into Thor's outstretched hand. Thor
          raises the hammer up high, and brings it down on the ground
          with all his might.
          KRAKABOOM! Lightning strikes down from the sky, the hammer
          channeling the blast, firing the electricity out at the
          Jotuns around him. They're blasted back in a massive
          shockwave. The Jotuns convulse, drop dead to the ground.


          But the force of the blast also cracks the ice below, the
          shockwave continuing to spread outwards. It moves out to
          where his comrades are running, breaking up the ground
          beneath them, exposing the black void of space below.

          VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)
          What's Thor done?

                         LOKI
          Likely killed us all!
          As the Jotuns race towards the Asgardians, they open their
          mouths wide and breathe out an ICY FOG. The swirling mists
          quickly engulf the fleeing Asgardians before them.
          The Asgardians stand in the mist, unable to see. Hogun takes
          a step back, the ice cracking beneath him. They dare not
          move, for fear of falling through, into the void below.
          Thor sees he's put his friends in even greater danger. He
          raises Mjolnir high, SUMMONING THE WINDS. They lift him off
          the ground and carry him across the frozen wasteland to his
          comrades.

          A EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (JOTUNHEIM) - DAY A

          Thor lands beside his comrades in the shroud of mists.

                         THOR
          Loki, we have to see.
          Loki raises his arms, concentrates, the mists dissipating.
          But as they do, the Asgardians see before them the faces of
          the Frost Giants. And there are HUNDREDS of them -- too
          many, even for a Thunder God.

                         VOLSTAGG

                         (TO LOKI)
          Actually, could you bring the mists
          back, please?
          Thor realizes that he and his comrades are as good as dead.
          The Giants move in for the kill, when they hear a deafening
          ROAR. A hole in the sky opens up, and the Bifrost blasts
          down onto the inner edge of the planet. Out of the maelstrom
          comes the sound of THUNDERING HOOVES, and, to the shock of
          all, tearing across the frozen wasteland comes --

                         ODIN ALLFATHER
          Astride his powerful, eight-legged steed SLEIPNIR. He's clad
          in battle armor, Gungnir in his hand -- an imposing sight.


          The Giants part in fear as he thunders into their ranks,
          stopping before Laufey and the Asgardians.
          Laufey slams his fists into the ground, and the ice beneath
          his feet raises him towards Odin. The Asgardians start to
          react, thinking it's an attack, but Laufey just stands face-
          to-face with Odin.
          Asgardian and Jotun alike look on uneasily, unsure what's
          about to happen.
          Laufey sizes up Odin, notices that as powerful as the
          Allfather still is, the years have taken their toll. He's
          not the foe he once was. The two rulers talk quietly, out of
          earshot of the others.

                         ODIN
          Laufey. End this.

                         LAUFEY
          Your boy sought this out.



                         ODIN
          You're right. These are the
          actions of a boy. Treat them as
          such. You and I can stop this
          before there's further bloodshed.
          Unseen by Odin and the others, Laufey starts to form an ice
          blade at the end of his arm.

                         LAUFEY
          We are beyond diplomacy now,
          Allfather. He'll get what he came
          for -- war and death.
          Odin looks grim, determined.

                         ODIN
          So be it.
          Without warning, Laufey swings his ice blade at Odin, but
          Odin is quicker. The Allfather brings his spear down upon
          the ice. Laufey and the nearest Jotuns go falling backwards
          in a wave, the ice cracking beneath their feet.
          The other Frost Giants turn tail and run. Thor watches the
          fleeing Jotuns with delight.

                         THOR
          Now! We'll finish them together!

                         ODIN
          Silence!
          Odin raises his spear. The hole in the sky opens, the
          Bifrost energy blasting forth from it. The Bifrost envelops
          the Asgardians, yanks them off the ground and up through the
          hole. The vortex closes behind them as all falls silent.
          Laufey stares up after them contemptuously.

           INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY - DAY 

          Heimdall stands at the Observatory controls. Odin pulls
          Heimdall's sword from the control panel and throws it to him.
          Heimdall backs away.

                         THOR
          Why did you bring us back?

                         ODIN
          Do you realize what you've done?
          What you've started?



                         THOR
          I was protecting my home.



                         ODIN
          You cannot protect your friends.
          How can you hope to protect a
          kingdom?
          Odin turns to the others.

          ODIN (CONT'D)

                         (RE: FANDRAL)
          Get him to the healing room!
          Sif, Volstagg, and Hogun hurry to help Fandral out of the
          room.

                         THOR
          There won't be a kingdom to protect
          if you're afraid to act!
          Odin stares at him.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          Whatever the cost, the world must
          know that the new King of Asgard
          will not be held in contempt.

                         ODIN
          That's pride and vanity that talks!
          Not leadership! Have you forgotten
          everything I've taught you? What
          of a warrior's patience, cunning?

                         THOR
          While you wait and be patient, the
          Nine Realms laugh at us! The old
          ways are done. You'd stand giving
          speeches while Asgard falls!

                         ODIN
          You're a vain, greedy, cruel boy!

                         THOR
          And you are an old man and a fool!
          The whole world seems to stop at Thor's words. Odin falls
          quiet. When he speaks again, there's something terrifying
          beneath the calmness of his words.

                         ODIN
          A fool, yes! I was a fool to think
          you were ready.
          Loki takes a step towards Odin imploringly.



                         LOKI

                         FATHER--
          Odin turns and gives Loki a look which stops him in his
          tracks.



                         ODIN
          Thor Odinson... You have disobeyed
          the express command of your King.
          Through your arrogance and
          stupidity, you have opened these
          peaceful Realms and innocent lives
          to the horrors of war.
          The Allfather plunges Gungnir into Observatory's control
          panel. The turret turns, the Bifrost energy building along
          with Odin's rage. It FIRES, as the Bifrost opens at the end
          of the platform, creating a portal behind Thor.
          Odin turns angrily to his son.

          ODIN (CONT'D)
          You are unworthy of this Realm...
          Odin RIPS a disc off Thor's chest.

          ODIN (CONT'D)
          ...unworthy of your title...
          He rips away Thor's cloak.

          ODIN (CONT'D)
          ...unworthy of the loved ones
          you've betrayed. I hereby take
          from you your powers.
          Odin extends his hand towards his son. Mjolnir goes flying
          from Thor's grasp into Odin's hand.

          ODIN (CONT'D)
          In the name of my father...
          A FINGER OF LIGHTNING comes off the hammer and hits Thor,
          disintegrating the right arm of his armor and part of the
          chest piece.

          ODIN (CONT'D)
          ...and of his father before...
          Another strike disintegrates the remainder of Thor's armor,
          including the cape and torn-away disc on the floor.

          ODIN (CONT'D)
          I cast you out!
          Odin thrusts Mjolnir before him and -- with a CRACK OF
          THUNDER -- Thor is hurled backwards into the open Bifrost and
          disappears in the vortex.


          Odin holds Mjolnir in his hand, stares at it bitterly. He
          closes his eyes, lost in contemplation, whispers something
          quietly.

          ODIN (CONT'D)

                         (WHISPERING)
          Whosoever holds this hammer, if he
          be worthy, shall possess the power
          of Thor.
          RUNES appear on the side of the hammer, as if carved into its
          smooth surface. The runes linger for but a moment, then
          disappear. Suddenly, Odin turns and hurls the hammer into
          the Bifrost.

          CUT TO BLACK.

           EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) - NIGHT 

          Thor opens his eyes, surrounded by darkness. Suddenly, he's
          blinded by bright headlights of a vehicle -- an SUV. It
          swerves, the side of it coming straight at him. It SLAMS
          into him, as we:

          CUT TO BLACK.


          After a beat, we hear familiar voices.

          DARCY (V.O.)
          I think that was legally your
          fault.

          JANE (V.O.)
          Get the first aid kit.

                         (THEN)
          Come on, big guy. Do me a favor
          and don't be dead, okay? Open your
          eyes and look at me.

          THOR'S POV
          Thor opens his eyes to see Jane Foster staring at him,
          concerned. She looks vulnerable and beautiful.

          DARCY (O.S.)
          Wow. Does he need CPR? Because I
          know CPR.

          END THOR'S POV

          TIME CUT TO:
          Jane regretfully watches the storm EVAPORATE above their
          heads. A thought strikes her.

                         JANE

                         (TO SELVIG)
          Where did he come from?
          They exchange puzzled looks when Thor GROANS again. He sits
          up abruptly, and Jane topples backwards in surprise.
          Thor staggers groggily to his feet, then turns and offers
          Jane a hand up. She takes it hesitantly, and he easily pulls
          her up. She can't help but marvel at his strength.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          Uh, thanks. Are you okay?
          Thor searches the ground.

                         THOR
          Hammer...

                         DARCY
          Yeah, we can tell you're hammered.
          That's pretty obvious.
          Jane notices something on the ground around them. She shines
          her flashlight down at the sand.



                         JANE
          Erik... look at this.
          He joins her at her side and sees it. A faint, discernible
          pattern is etched into the sand. They exchange a look.
          Amazed and excited, Jane hurriedly takes out a camera and
          snaps some photos of the runes. A breeze begins to blow them
          away.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          We've got to move fast before
          anything changes.

                         (MORE)



          JANE (CONT'D)
          We need soil samples, light
          readings, everything.
          She pulls out a light meter, holds it up, takes some
          readings, jots them down in her notebook. Selvig looks at
          Thor, who stares up at the sky.

                         SELVIG
          Jane, we need get him to a
          hospital.
          Jane kneels and quickly scoops up a soil sample in the
          cannister.

                         JANE
          Not right now. It'll take too
          long. County's an hour away.
          We'll drop him off after we're done
          here.
          Selvig looks uncertain.

          JANE (CONT'D)

                         (RE: THOR)
          Look at him, he's fine.
          Thor stares up at the stars, shouts up at them angrily.

                         THOR
          Father! Heimdall! I know you can
          hear me! Open the bridge!

                         JANE
          (off Selvig's look)
          Okay, you and Darcy take him to the
          hospital, I'll stay here.

                         SELVIG
          You expect me to leave you alone in
          the middle of the desert?
          Thor turns to the others, frustrated.

                         THOR
          You! What world is this?
          The group is intimidated by his fervor.

                         SELVIG
          It's all right, my friend. We're
          going to get you some help.
          Selvig touches Thor's shoulder. Thor shoves him off, grows
          agitated, belligerent.



                         THOR
          Where am I?! Answer me!
          Darcy reaches into her fanny pack, pulls something out of it.
          Jane looks on, concerned.



                         JANE
          Erik, just back away...

                         SELVIG
          (to Thor, calming)
          You're in the desert outside the
          town of Puente Antiguo.

                         THOR
          What Realm?! Alfheim? Nornheim?

                         DARCY
          Uh... New Mexico?
          Darcy raises a TASER at him. Thor looks at the weapon,
          unsure what to make of it.

                         THOR
          You dare threaten Thor with so puny

                         A--
          Darcy fires, the electrified wires shooting out of the taser,
          ZAPPING him in the chest. Thor convulses, falls to the
          ground unconscious. Jane and Selvig stare at her, shocked.

                         DARCY
          What? He was freaking me out.

           EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) - MOMENTS LATER 

          As Jane still takes soil samples, Darcy and Selvig struggle
          to drag an unconscious Thor to the SUV and lift him inside.

                         SELVIG

                         (TO DARCY)
          Next time you decide to taser
          someone, do me a favor and make
          sure they're already inside the
          truck.

                         (TO JANE)
          Jane, come on...
          Reluctantly, Jane joins the others inside the SUV.

           EXT. DESERT - MOMENTS LATER 

          The SUV heads off into the distance. Behind it, high
          overhead, a HOLE opens in the sky. A last blast of Bifrost
          energy bursts forth from it, and a small OBJECT comes firing
          into our world. It BURNS across the desert sky like a
          meteor.

                          OMITTED 

 

           EXT. COUNTY HOSPITAL - NIGHT 

          The SUV sits parked before the emergency room entrance.

           INT. COUNTY HOSPITAL ER - NIGHT 

          Selvig watches the unconscious Thor with interest as two
          ORDERLIES set the Asgardian onto a gurney. Jane and Darcy
          stand before a sweet, ditzy ADMISSIONS NURSE.

                         ADMISSIONS NURSE
          Name?

                         JANE
          He said it was "Thor."
          The Nurse painstakingly types it into the computer, one key
          at a time. Jane watches as Thor is wheeled out of the room.

                         ADMISSIONS NURSE

                         (SPELLING)
          T-H-O-R. And your relationship to
          him?

                         JANE
          I've never met him before.

                         DARCY
          Until she hit him with the car.

                         JANE
          Grazed him, actually.

                         (THEN)
          Oh, and we tasered him, too.

                         ADMISSIONS NURSE

                         (SYMPATHETIC)
          Must have been quite the spat.

                         JANE
          I told you, I don't know him. I
          just want to make sure he's okay.

                         ADMISSIONS NURSE
          I'm going to need a name and
          contact number.

                         JANE
          Jane Foster.

                         ADMISSIONS NURSE

                         (TYPING SLOWLY)

          J...A...N...



                         SELVIG
          Oh, for God's sake...
          He reaches over Jane's shoulder and hands the Nurse his
          business card.

          SELVIG (CONT'D)
          Here. Let's go.
          Selvig, Darcy, and Jane head out.

  .

           INT. HOSPITAL ER - NIGHT 

          Thor, now in a hospital gown, winces in pain as he awakens on
          a gurney to find a NURSE standing over him, a syringe in his
          arm.

                         NURSE
          Hi. Just taking a little blood.
          Thor SLAPS the syringe away angrily, starts to sit up.

                         THOR
          How dare you attack the son of
          Odin!

                         NURSE
          I need some help!
          Two ORDERLIES race over, try to hold Thor down.

          NURSE (CONT'D)
          We're trying to help you!

                         THOR
          Then bring me a healing stone, you
          savages!
          He hurls one of them off, smashing against a wall. Now a
          couple SECURITY GUARDS and MALE NURSES join the fracas, all
          struggling to hold Thor down. Medical equipment goes flying,
          furniture overturned.

                         ORDERLY
          What the hell is this guy on?
          Finally, they force him back down onto the gurney. Thor
          looks shocked and amazed that he's actually being overpowered
          by this small group. The NURSE injects him with a sedative.

                         THOR
          You're no match for the Mighty--
          Thor struggles a beat, then passes out.

           EXT. NEW MEXICO DESERT - DAWN 

          Smoke rises from a fifty foot wide CRATER. A TOWNIE pulls
          his pick-up to a stop at the crater's edge. He climbs out,
          peers down below, his curiosity piqued by what he sees.

                         TOWNIE
          Huh.


          The Townie approaches something at the center of the crater.
          We don't see what it is, but it bathes him in an
          otherworldly, BLUE LUMINOUS GLOW. He reaches for the object,
          tries to lift it, but can't. He redoubles his efforts,
          strains with all his might, with no luck.
          He takes off his hat, fans himself, stares at the mysterious
          object.

 

           TOWNIE (CONT'D)
           Huh.

           EXT./INT. SMITH MOTORS - LAB - MORNING 

          The distant mountains glint snow in the early morning light.
          Selvig appears with a cup of coffee and surveys the vast
          desert. He turns back into the lab and sees Jane, busy at
          her workstation, soldering a piece of equipment.
          A printer churns out blown-up screen-cap PHOTOS of the
          Bifrost footage. Darcy hangs them on the wall.
          Selvig surveys the scene, watches how Jane works, impressed.
          He notices a monitor which displays a complex program
          entitled "J. FOSTER ALGORITHM ANALYSIS". He looks proud.
          The three of them have been up all night, fueled by caffeine
          and excitement.

                         JANE
          Darcy, when you're done, take the
          soil samples to Professor Meyers in
          geology. Remind him, he owes me.

                         SELVIG
          We might want to perform a spectral
          analysis.

                         JANE
          "We?"

                         SELVIG
          I flew all the way out here --
          might as well make myself useful.
          This is the offer Jane's been waiting for. She gets up,
          inserts the piece of equipment she's been working on into a
          rack-mounted server.

                         JANE
          You know what would be really
          useful? Do you still have that
          friend at LIGO?

                         SELVIG
          She was more than a friend.

                         JANE
          Could you call in a favor?

                         SELVIG
          You don't think this was just a
          magnetic storm?



                         JANE
          If I'm right, their observatory
          must have picked up gravitational
          waves during last night's event.

                         SELVIG
          Meaning?
          Jane heads over to a computer monitor. Selvig follows.

                         JANE
          Meaning these anomalies might
          signify something bigger.

                         SELVIG
          How "big" are we talking about?
          Jane indicates the footage on the monitor. As the last of
          the Bifrost cloud disappears into the night sky, there
          appears to be a blister in space, bulging out in convex and
          covered with stars.

                         JANE
          I think the lensing around the
          edges is characteristic of an
          Einstein-Rosen Bridge.

                         DARCY
          A what?

                         SELVIG
          I thought you were a science major.

                         DARCY
          Political Science.
          Selvig shoots Jane a confused look. Jane shrugs.

                         JANE
          She was the only applicant.

                         SELVIG

                         (TO DARCY)
          An Einstein-Rosen Bridge -- a
          "theoretical" connection between
          two different points of space-time.
          Darcy stares blankly.

                         JANE

                         (TO DARCY)
          A wormhole.

 B.
          Selvig looks skeptical. Jane prints out a frame-grab off the
          monitor.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          Erik, look...


          Jane indicates the print-out showing the constellations seen
          through the "bubble" in the clouds.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          What do you see here?

                         SELVIG
          Stars.

                         JANE
          Yes. But not our stars.
          She spreads out a STAR CHART, barely able to contain her
          excitement.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          This is the star alignment for our
          quadrant, this time of year. So
          unless Ursa Minor decided to take
          the day off... those are someone
          else's constellations.
          Selvig's intrigued, in spite of himself.
          Darcy pulls another frame-grab of the Bifrost footage from
          the printer and hangs it on the wall, when something in the
          image catches her eye.

                         DARCY
          Hey, check it out.
          Jane and Selvig examine the photo, amazed.

                         SELVIG
          Is that...?

                         JANE
          I think I left something at the
          hospital.
          As Jane walks away, we REVEAL the photo. Inside the Bifrost
          funnel cloud is a FIGURE -- the vague, but unmistakable shape
          of a MAN.

          A EXT. ODIN'S CHAMBERS - DAY A

          At the top of the palace, we see a small FIGURE on the
          balcony. As we move closer, we see it is a burdened Odin,
          looking out over Asgard.

           INT. ODIN'S CHAMBERS - DAY 

          Frigga enters to find Odin standing lost in thought.



                         FRIGGA
          How could you have done this?

                         ODIN
          Do you understand what he set in
          motion? He's taken us to the brink
          of war!

                         FRIGGA
          But banishment? You would lose him
          forever? He's your son!

                         ODIN
          What would you have done?



                         FRIGGA
          I would not have exiled him to a
          world of mortals, stripped of his
          powers, to suffer alone. I would
          not have had the heart for such
          cruelty!

                         ODIN
          That is why I'm King.

                         (THEN)
          I, too, grieve the loss of our son.
          But there are some things that even
          I cannot undo.

                         FRIGGA
          You can bring him back.

                         ODIN
          No. His fate is in his own hands
          now.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY 

          Thor awakens on a hospital bed. He notices RESTRAINTS on his
          wrists now. He pulls at them, tries to free himself, to no
          avail.

                         THOR
          It's not possible.
          He tries again, mustering all his strength. One of his hands
          slips free from its restraint.

          A INT. COUNTY HOSPITAL ER - DAY A

          Jane again faces the Admissions Nurse, with Selvig and Darcy
          nearby.

                         ADMISSIONS NURSE
          I'm sorry, only relatives can visit
          patients.

                         JANE

                         (THINKING FAST)
          But... I'm his wife.
          Darcy stifles a SNICKER at this, as the Nurse looks doubtful.

                         ADMISSIONS NURSE
          I thought you said you didn't know
          him.



                         JANE
          I meant I barely know him anymore.
          The man he's become. He's changed.
          I mean, what woman really knows her
          husband, anyway?

                         ADMISSIONS NURSE
          None of us, dear. He's in Room

          .

           INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY 

          Jane, Selvig, and Darcy head down the corridor, passing the
          destruction of the ER Thor wrecked the previous night.


          They enter Thor's room.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM 

          They step inside to find Thor's bed empty.

           EXT. HOSPITAL PARKING LOT - DAY 

          Jane, Selvig, and Darcy quickly climb into Jane's SUV.

           INT. JANE'S SUV 

          Jane starts the car, frustrated.

                         JANE
          Typical. I just lost my most
          important piece of evidence.

                         DARCY
          So now what?

                         JANE
          We find him.

                         SELVIG
          Did you see what he did in there?
          I don't know if finding him is the
          best idea.

                         JANE
          I want to know what that thing was,
          and he may have the answers. We
          don't have a choice.

                         DARCY
          Oo-kay.
          She pulls out her taser and a can of mace.

                         SELVIG
          So we're just going to spend the
          rest of the day looking for him?

                         JANE
          However long it takes.
          Jane puts the car in reverse and backs up, when --

          BAM!
          She collides with Thor again, dressed in stolen hospital
          scrubs. Jane and Selvig exchange a look.

 

           EXT. HOSPITAL PARKING LOT - DAY 

          Jane and Selvig emerge from the SUV, help Thor to his feet.

                         JANE
          I'm so sorry. I swear I'm not
          doing that on purpose.


          Thor looks up at the sky.

                         THOR
          Blue sky... one sun... This is
          Earth, isn't it?

                         DARCY
          I think you may have hit him with
          the car one time too many.

                         JANE

                         (TO THOR)
          Let's get you some clothes.

           INT. HEALING ROOM - DAY 

          Sif, Loki, and the Warriors three, battered and shell-
          shocked, still reeling from the day's events, sit before a
          ROARING central fire.
          Hogun reaches into the flames, pulls out some fragile HEALING
          STONES. Neither the fire, nor the stones burn him. As he
          carefully places the stones over the wounds of his comrades,
          the stones begin to glow. He crushes them to a powder. His
          comrades' injuries heal up at the glowing powder's touch.
          Fandral winces in pain as Hogun heals his gaping wound.
          Volstagg looks at the skin on his arm -- healing, but still
          blackened from the necrotizing touch of the Frost Giant.
          Loki watches him, then stares at his own arm, where the
          Giant's touch turned his skin blue. It's undamaged, back to
          its normal color.

                         VOLSTAGG
          We should never have let him go.

                         SIF
          There was no stopping him.

                         FANDRAL
          At least he's only banished, not
          dead. Which is what we'd all be if
          that guard hadn't told Odin where
          we'd gone.

                         VOLSTAGG
          How did the guard even know?
          Loki stares at his arm.

                         LOKI
          I told him.

 

                          FANDRAL
          What?

                         LOKI
          I told him to go to Odin after we'd
          left. Though he should be flogged
          for taking so long.



                         VOLSTAGG
          You told the guard?

                         LOKI
          I saved our lives! And Thor's. I
          had no idea Father would banish him
          for what he did.

                         SIF
          Loki, you're the only one who can
          help Thor now. You must go to the
          Allfather and convince him to
          change his mind!

                         LOKI
          And if I do, then what? I love
          Thor more dearly than any of you,
          but you know what he is. He's
          arrogant. He's reckless. He's
          dangerous. You saw how he was
          today. Is that what Asgard needs
          from its King?
          The others exchange glances, torn. Loki has a point. He
          leaves the room. Hogun stares after him.

                         SIF
          He may speak about the good of
          Asgard, but he's always been
          jealous of Thor.

                         VOLSTAGG
          True, but we should be grateful to
          him. He did save our lives.

                         HOGUN
          Laufey said there were traitors in
          the House of Odin.
          The others turn to the usually quiet Hogun.

                         FANDRAL
          Why is it every time you choose to
          speak, it has to be something dark
          and ominous?

                         HOGUN
          A master of magic could easily
          bring three Jotuns into Asgard.
          The others look to Hogun, understanding the implication.

                         VOLSTAGG
          No! Surely not!



                         FANDRAL
          Loki's always been one for
          mischief, but you're talking about
          something else entirely.



                         SIF
          Who else could elude Heimdall's
          gaze with tricks of light and
          shadow?

                         VOLSTAGG
          The ceremony was interrupted just
          before Thor was named King.

                         SIF
          We should go to the Allfather.

                         FANDRAL
          And tell him what? "Oh, by the
          way, we think your son just
          betrayed the throne. And do us a
          favor. Bring back Thor. There's a
          good fellow!"

                         SIF
          It's our duty. If any of our
          suspicions are right, then all of
          Asgard is in danger.

           INT. VAULT - DAY 

          Loki heads into the Vault, sees the Casket of Ancient Winters
          sitting on its stand.
          He walks over to it slowly, reaches out to it, lifts it
          between his forearms off its pedestal. As he does, a
          blueness spreads from his arms, across his body.
          The latticework behind the Casket starts to separate, the
          Destroyer rousing. A fire starts to glow within its black
          metal armor, as it rattles to life, but Loki ignores it --
          the blueness spreading further, consuming his whole body.

 

           ODIN (O.S.)
          Stop!
          Loki turns, sees Odin hurrying into the room, the Destroyer
          goes motionless, the latticework rejoining before it.
          Odin eyes Loki with dismay.

                         LOKI
          Am I cursed?

                         ODIN
          No. Put the Casket down.
          Loki sets the Casket back upon its pedestal, his body quickly
          returning to its normal form and color. He stares at his
          father.

                         LOKI
          What am I?

                         ODIN
          You're my son.

                         LOKI
          What more than that?
          Odin doesn't answer. He looks suddenly weary, burdened.
          Loki sizes him up, realizes the truth.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          The Casket wasn't the only thing
          you took from Jotunheim that day,
          was it?
          Odin looks him in the eye. He can deny it no longer.

                         ODIN
          No.

                         (BEAT)
          In the aftermath of the battle, I
          went into the Temple, and I found a
          baby. Small for a giant's
          offspring -- abandoned, suffering,
          left to die. Laufey's son.
          Loki is sent reeling by the revelation.

                         LOKI
          Laufey's son...
          He desperately struggles to make sense of it all.



          LOKI (CONT'D)
          Why? You were knee-deep in Jotun
          blood. Why would you take me?

                         ODIN
          You were an innocent child.

                         LOKI
          You took me for a purpose, what was
          it?
          Odin doesn't answer.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          Tell me!

                         ODIN
          I thought we could unite our
          kingdoms one day, bring about an
          alliance, bring about a permanent
          peace... through you. But those
          plans no longer matter.

                         LOKI
          So I am no more than another stolen
          relic, locked up here until you
          might have use of me.

                         ODIN
          Why do you twist my words?

                         LOKI
          You could have told me what I was
          from the beginning. Why didn't
          you?

                         ODIN
          You are my son. My blood. I
          wanted only to protect you from the
          truth.

                         LOKI
          Because I am the monster parents
          tell their children about at night?

                         ODIN
          Don't...

                         LOKI
          It all makes sense now. Why you
          favored Thor all these years.

                         ODIN
          Listen...

 B.

                         LOKI
          Because no matter how much you
          claim to "love" me, you could never
          have a Frost Giant sitting on the
          Throne of Asgard!
          Odin's body begins to shake, he lifts his hand. It starts to
          move out of synch temporarily, leaving a trail, the effect of
          the Odinsleep approaching. Loki doesn't notice as Odin tries
          to fight it off.

                         ODIN
          Listen to me!
          Loki strides away towards the exit.

          ODIN (CONT'D)
          Loki!
          Odin starts towards him, when the enormous mental, emotional,
          and physical strain of recent events finally takes its toll.
          The effect of the Odinsleep consumes him. His entire body
          now moves out of sync with the rest of the world, leaving
          trails behind him as he staggers backwards.
          Odin falls back against a wall, his face contorting in a
          scream. He collapses to the stone floor.
          Loki, shocked, hurries to him. He takes Odin in his arms,
          calls out.

                         LOKI

           EXT. OUTSIDE OF CRATER - DAY 

          Cars, pick-ups, and SUVs are parked around the crater, the
          sound of a BOISTEROUS PARTY coming from within.

 

           EXT. INSIDE OF CRATER 

          It looks like the whole town has turned out. LOCALS sit on
          lounge chairs, drink beer from coolers, laugh and talk. They
          watch the center of the crater, where LARGE MEN have formed a
          line to take a turn with the mysterious object.
          One of them struggles and fails to lift it. As he gives up,
          the next man steps up and takes his turn, straining from the
          effort. Other Townies SNAP PICTURES of the scene with their
          cell phones.
          They hear an approaching RUMBLE, then clear a path as a large
          PICK-UP TRUCK backs its way down the crater's edge. An EAGER
          TOWNIE hops out the passenger side and pulls a thick chain
          from the back of the truck.
          He fastens one end around the object, then securely affixes
          the chain to the bumper and the rear of the undercarriage.

                         EAGER TOWNIE
          This'll do it.
          He yells to the driver.

          EAGER TOWNIE (CONT'D)
          Okay, let 'er rip!
          The townsfolk watch as the pick-up's engine ROARS, then
          STRAINS, its wheels spinning futilely, until finally the rear
          of the truck, along with the back wheels and axles, break off
          and go flying.
          People dive out of the way.
          The PICK-UP DRIVER sticks his head out. He is STAN "THE MAN"
          LEE. He looks back, shocked. The townsfolk laugh, the party
          continuing. They don't notice as --

          ON THE CRATER'S EDGE ABOVE THEM
          An imposing GOVERNMENT VEHICLE pulls up to a stop. A Fed in
          a suit climbs out, peers down at the boisterous gathering
          below, his eyes fixed on the object at the center of the
          crater.
          He is SHIELD AGENT COULSON. He stares down at the object
          which glows with an otherworldly blue energy -- MJOLNIR. He
          pulls out a phone.

                         COULSON

                         (INTO PHONE)
          Sir -- we've found it.

 

           INT. SMITH MOTORS - LAB - DAY 

          In a back room, Thor, now shirtless and wearing jeans, looks
          around for a t-shirt.
          Jane and Darcy, standing in the lab, can't help but notice
          his reflection in the mirror. Darcy eyes his powerful build,
          rippling biceps.

                         DARCY
          You know, for a crazy homeless guy,
          he's pretty cut.
          Jane turns away. Thor emerges from the back room, holding a
          t-shirt.

          DARCY (CONT'D)
          Hey, sorry I tased you!
          Thor heads over to Jane's work area, starts fiddling with the
          equipment there with interest. Jane hurries over to put a
          stop to it.

                         JANE
          Excuse me... excuse me!
          She leads him away from the work station. Thor holds up the
          t-shirt. On the front, it bear a sticker which reads:
          "HELLO, MY NAME IS DR. DONALD BLAKE". Thor looks at it,
          puzzled. Jane rips the sticker off.

 

           JANE (CONT'D)
          My ex.
          Thor stares at her a beat.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          They're the only clothes I had
          that'll fit you. Sorry.

                         THOR
          They will suffice.
          Thor turns his attention to the pictures of the Bifrost on
          the wall.

                         JANE
          You're welcome. Now tell me...
          Thor studies the frame-grabs with interest. Jane points to
          his form in the Bifrost photo.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          What were you doing, in that?
          He glances at it, dismissive.

                         THOR
          What does anyone do in the Bifrost?
          Everyone stares at him. Selvig seems to recognize the word.
          Jane opens her notebook, quickly writes the word down. Thor
          moves close to her, eyes the notations and drawings within
          the book, curious.

                         SELVIG
          (amused, skeptical)
          The Bifrost...
          Jane starts to get uncomfortable with Thor standing so close
          to her, looking over her notations. She quickly closes the
          book.

                         JANE
          What exactly is the Bifrost?

                         THOR

                         (IGNORING HER)
          This mortal form has grown weak.

                         JANE

                         BUT--



          JANE (CONT'D)
          Somebody get the mortal a Pop-Tart.

           INT. ODIN'S CHAMBERS - DAY 

          Frigga sits at her husband's bedside, holding his hand. Odin
          lies there -- looking pale and lifeless, his body and the
          space around it warped from the effect of the Odinsleep. The
          walls of the chamber have moved close around him, protecting
          him like a dark crypt, sealing off any daylight.
          Loki sits at Odin's side, across from Frigga. She speaks
          softly to him.

                         FRIGGA
          I asked him to be honest with you
          from the beginning. There should
          be no secrets in a family.

                         LOKI
          So why did he lie?

                         FRIGGA
          He kept the truth from you so that
          you would never feel different.
          You are in every way our son, Loki,
          and we your family. You must know
          that.
          Loki takes this in, stares at Odin.

          FRIGGA (CONT'D)

                         (RE: ODIN)
          You can speak to him. He can see
          and hear us, even now.

                         LOKI
          How long will it last?



                         FRIGGA
          I don't know. This time is
          different. We were unprepared.

                         LOKI
          I never get used to seeing him like
          this. The most powerful being in
          the Nine Realms lying helpless
          until his body is restored.

                         FRIGGA
          But he's put it off for so long
          now, I fear...
          Loki takes her hand. She's grateful, wipes tears from her
          eyes.

          FRIGGA (CONT'D)
          You're a good son.
          Loki sits there, uncertain how to react, uncertain how he
          really feels.

          FRIGGA (CONT'D)
          We mustn't lose hope that your
          father will return to us. And your
          brother.
          Loki looks to Frigga, concerned.

                         LOKI
          What hope is there for Thor?

                         FRIGGA
          There's always a purpose to
          everything your father does. Thor
          may yet find a way home.
          Loki looks troubled by the revelation. He rises, heads for
          the exit, when they hear the clatter of ARMORED FOOTSTEPS
          hurriedly approaching.

          THE EINHERJAR GUARD
          Enter the room, block his way out. Loki tenses, prepared for
          the worst, but the guards just stand before them. Loki is
          baffled.

          FRIGGA (CONT'D)
          Thor is banished. The line of
          succession falls to you. Until he
          awakens, Asgard is yours.


          The Einherjar kneel before the shocked Loki. Another
          EINHERJAR enters, holding Gungnir before him. He kneels
          before Loki, offers the spear to him.

          FRIGGA (CONT'D)
          Make your father proud.
          Loki reaches out tentatively, then takes it. He likes the
          feel of it in his hand.

 

           INT. ISABELA'S DINER - MORNING 

          Thor, Selvig, Darcy, and Jane sit at a table in the local
          diner. Selvig and Darcy watch as Thor eats ravenously from a
          huge mound of steak and eggs. A couple other full plates --
          pancakes and biscuits and gravy -- are piled high before him.
          Jane's eager, her notebook at the ready.

                         JANE
          Now tell us exactly what happened
          to you last night.
          Thor looks her in the eyes, staring, intrigued. Jane gets
          flustered, looks away.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          Maybe start with how you got inside
          that cloud.

                         DARCY
          And how you could eat an entire box
          of Pop-Tarts and still be this
          hungry.
          Jane shoots her a withering look. Thor downs a cup of
          coffee.

                         THOR
          (re: coffee mug)
          This drink. I like it.

                         DARCY
          (to Thor, re: coffee)
          Yeah, it's great, isn't it?
          Isabela makes the best coffee in
          town.
          Thor hurls the empty mug at the ground, SHATTERING it.

                         THOR

                         (CALLS OUT)
          Another!
          ISABELA ALVAREZ (), the diner's proprietor, glares at Thor
          from behind the counter.

                         JANE
          Sorry, Izzy. Little accident.

                         (IN SPANISH)
          Yo voy a pagar la taza.
          Isabela turns to a WAITRESS and starts venting quickly in
          Spanish.



                         ISABELA

                         (IN SPANISH)
          Did you see that? The first time
          she brings a man in here, and he's
          a lunatic!

                         JANE
          (to Thor, re: mug)
          What was that?
          He doesn't understand. The other patrons stare at him.

                         THOR
          It was delicious. I want another.

                         JANE
          Then you should just say so!

                         THOR
          I just did.

                         JANE
          I mean ask for it. Nicely.

                         THOR
          I meant no disrespect.

                         JANE
          All right, then no more smashing,
          deal?

                         THOR
          You have my word.

                         JANE
          Good.


          A few TOWNIES, looking bedraggled, enter and take a seat at
          the counter. We recognize them from the crater. (Among them
          is the Drunk Townie Jake, who is not presently drunk.)

                         ISABELA
          Morning, Pete. Jake.

                         TOWNIE PETE
          The usual, please, Izzy.
          Isabela pours them a couple cups of coffee.

          DRUNK TOWNIE JAKE
          You missed all the excitement out
          at the crater.

                         ISABELA
          What crater?
          Jane and Selvig overhear this, exchange a look, turn to the
          Townies with interest.

                         TOWNIE PETE
          They're saying some kind of
          satellite crashed in the desert.

          DRUNK TOWNIE JAKE
          We were having a good time with it
          till the Feds showed up, chased us
          out.

                         JANE
          (to the Townies)
          Excuse me, did you say there was a
          satellite crash?

          DRUNK TOWNIE JAKE
          Yep. They said it was radioactive.
          And I had my hands all over it.

                         (REALIZING)
          I'm probably sterile now.
          Thor, unconcerned, prepares to dig into the giant pile of
          pancakes. Darcy is amazed by the sight.

                         DARCY
          Oh my God, this is going on
          Facebook.
          Darcy whips out her cellphone.

          DARCY (CONT'D)

                         (TO THOR)
          Smile!


          Thor looks puzzled as she SNAPS a photo of him and his
          massive stack of food.

                         SELVIG
          (to the Townies)
          What did the satellite look like?

          DRUNK TOWNIE JAKE
          I don't know nothing about
          satellites. But it was heavy.
          Real heavy. Nobody could lift it.
          This gets Thor's attention.


          Thor springs to his feet, heads over to Drunk Townie Jake,
          and pulls the Townie around to face him.

                         THOR
          Where?!

          DRUNK TOWNIE JAKE
          About twelve miles east of here.
          Thor grins, his spirits soaring, as he quickly strides out of
          the diner.

                         PETE
          I wouldn't bother! Looked like the
          whole Army was coming in when we
          left!

           EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY 

          Thor studies the position of the sun, gauging his bearings.
          Jane, Darcy, and Selvig catch up to him.

                         JANE
          Where are you going?

                         THOR
          Twelve miles east of here.
          He starts to stride determinedly down the street. Jane walks
          with him.

                         JANE
          Why?

                         THOR
          To get what belongs to me.

                         JANE
          So now you own a satellite?

                         THOR
          It's not what they say it is.

                         JANE
          Whatever it is, the government
          seems to think it's theirs. You
          intend to just walk in there and
          take it?

                         THOR
          Yes.
          He stops walking.



          THOR (CONT'D)
          If you take me there now, I'll tell
          you everything you wish to know.

                         JANE
          Everything?

                         THOR
          All the answers you seek will be
          yours, once I reclaim Mjolnir.
          Darcy looks to the others.

                         DARCY
          "Myeu-muh?" What's "Myeu-muh?"
          Jane studies Thor. He looks sincere. She's nearly swayed,

                         WHEN:

                         SELVIG
          Jane.
          He pulls her aside. Thor can tell that Selvig doesn't much
          care for him.

          SELVIG (CONT'D)

                         (TO JANE)
          Please don't do this.

                         JANE
          You know what we saw last night.
          This can't be a coincidence. I
          want to know what's in that crater.

                         SELVIG
          I'm not talking about the crater.
          I'm talking about him.

                         JANE
          He's promised us answers.

                         SELVIG
          He's delusional! Listen to what
          he's saying! "Thor." "Bifrost."
          "Mjolnir." These are the stories I
          grew up with as a child!

                         JANE
          I'd just be driving him out there,
          that's all.

                         SELVIG
          It's dangerous. He's dangerous.


          After a moment, she nods. They head back over to Thor and
          Darcy.

                         JANE
          I'm sorry. I can't take you.

                         THOR
          I understand. Then this is where
          we say goodbye.
          He takes her hand and kisses it.

                         JANE
          That's... thank you.
          Thor bows slightly to each of them.

                         THOR
          Jane Foster... Erik Selvig...
          Darcy. Farewell.
          He heads off down the street. Selvig looks relieved.

                         SELVIG
          Now... let's get back to the lab.
          We have work to do.
          Selvig and Darcy turn and start to go. Jane looks after Thor
          as he walks away down the street.

           EXT. ODIN'S PALACE - DAY 

          Sif joins the Warriors Three as they hurry towards the Throne
          Room.

           INT. THRONE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 

          Two EINHERJAR GUARDS enter, admitting Sif and the Warriors
          Three, who burst through the entrance, heads bowed.



                         SIF
          Allfather, we must speak with you

                         URGENTLY--
          But as they raise their heads, they stop short to see --

                         LOKI
          Sitting sprawled upon his father's throne. He wears his
          horned ceremonial headdress and holds GUNGNIR in his hand.
          Sif and the others look up, shocked at the sight before them.

                         VOLSTAGG
          What is this?

                         LOKI
          My friends... you haven't heard? I
          am now Ruler of Asgard.

                         FANDRAL
          Where is Odin?

                         LOKI
          Father's fallen into the Odinsleep.
          My mother fears he may never awaken
          again.

                         SIF
          We would speak with her.
          Sif and the Warriors Three exchange a look. Loki notices.

                         LOKI
          She has refused to leave my
          father's bedside. You can bring
          your "urgent" matter to me, your
          King.
          Sif covers quickly.

                         SIF
          We would ask you to end Thor's
          banishment.

 .

                         LOKI
          My first command can not be to undo
          the Allfather's last. We're on the
          brink of war with Jotunheim. Our
          people must have a sense of
          continuity in order to feel safe in
          these difficult times.
          Sif and the Warriors Three trade looks, not liking any of
          this.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          All of us must stand together, for
          the good of Asgard.

                         FANDRAL
          Of course.
          Sif and the Warriors Three bow their heads and exit. Loki
          stares after them.

           EXT. PUENTE ANTIGUO, NEW MEXICO - MAIN STREET - DAY 

          Jane, Selvig, and Darcy head up the street. They're by
          Arturo's, when a PICK-UP TRUCK pulls up before them, stopped
          by traffic. In the back of the vehicle, Jane notices,
          partially covered by a tarp, the dark matter analysis machine
          from her lab.

                         JANE
          Hey! That's my stuff!

          A EXT. SMITH MOTORS - LAB A

          Jane, Selvig, and Darcy reach the lab, where government
          vehicles are parked. SHIELD AGENTS haul equipment out of the
          lab and load it into waiting vans. Other Agents strip all
          the equipment from inside the Pinzgauer and cart it away.
          Still others emerge from her trailer, arms loaded with
          scientific instruments and documents.

                         JANE
          What the hell is going on here?!
          The Agents ignore her as Agent Coulson approaches.

                         COULSON
          Ms. Foster, I'm Agent Coulson, with

          SHIELD.
          Selvig, recognizing the name of the organization, grows wary.



                         JANE
          I don't care who you work for, you
          can't do this!

                         SELVIG
          Jane. This is more serious than
          you realize. Let it go.

                         JANE
          Let it go?! This is my life!

                         COULSON
          We're here investigating a security
          threat. We need to appropriate
          your equipment and all your
          atmospheric data.

                         JANE
          By "appropriate" you mean "steal?"
          Instead of answering, Coulson gives her a check.

                         COULSON
          This should more than compensate
          you for your trouble.
          She throws the check to the ground without looking at it.

                         JANE
          I can't just pick up replacements
          from RadioShack! I made most of
          that equipment myself!

                         COULSON
          Then I'm sure you can do it again.

                         JANE
          And I'm sure I can sue you for
          violating my constitutional rights!



                         COULSON
          We're the good guys, Ms. Foster.
          He tries to walk away, but Jane blocks his path. She is
          fully herself, fueled by outrage.

                         JANE
          So are we! We're on the verge of

                         UNDERSTANDING SOMETHING
          extraordinary.
          Jane holds up her notebook.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          Everything I know about this
          phenomenon is in this lab and in
          this book, and no one has the right
          to take it from me.
          Coulson gestures to a nearby AGENT, who promptly plucks the
          notebook out of Jane's hands and adds it to the pile he's
          carrying. Jane is stunned.

                         COULSON
          Thank you for your cooperation.
          He gets into a car. The cars and trucks pull away.

           INT. SMITH MOTORS - LAB - DAY 

          Jane, Selvig, and Darcy enter, staring in shock at the now-
          empty space.

                         JANE
          Years of research, gone.



                         DARCY
          They even took my iPod.

                         SELVIG
          And your back-ups?

                         JANE
          Look around! They took our back-
          ups. They took the back-ups of our
          back-ups.

                         DARCY
          I just downloaded, like, thirty
          songs on there.

                         JANE

                         (TO DARCY)
          Will you please stop talking about
          your iPod?!

                         (TO SELVIG)
          Who are these people?

                         SELVIG
          No one knows much about them. But
          I knew a scientist -- a pioneer in
          gamma radiation. SHIELD showed up,
          and he was never heard from again.

                         JANE
          I'm not going to let them do this.
          I'm getting everything back.

                         SELVIG
          Please, let me contact one of my
          colleagues. Dr. Pym has had some
          dealings with these people. I'll e-
          mail him and see if he can help.

                         DARCY
          They took your laptop, too.
          Annoyed, Selvig thinks.

          A EXT. PUENTE ANTIGUO LIBRARY - DAY A

          Selvig and Jane in the Pinzgauer drive up in front of the
          town's rinky-dink library. A sign in the window reads, "FREE

          INTERNET."

                         SELVIG
          I'll just be a minute.
          He climbs out and heads inside. Jane looks down the street
          and sees something that intrigues her.

 

           INT. PET STORE - DAY 

          Thor enters the store and approaches a PET STORE CLERK.

                         THOR
          I need a horse.

          PET STORE CLERK
          Sorry, we don't sell horses. Just
          dogs, cats, birds.

                         THOR
          Then give me one of those, large
          enough to ride.
          The Pet Store Clerk looks confused.
          Just then, Thor hears a CAR HORN. He turns to the open door.
          Across the street, Jane calls to him from the Pinzgauer.



                         JANE
          You still want a lift?

          A INT. PUENTE ANTIGUO LIBRARY - DAY A

          It's story time in the library, as a LIBRARIAN reads a book --
          "THE SECRET HISTORY OF GIANTS" -- to a group of kids.

                         LIBRARIAN

                         (READING)
          "And though they're large, giants
          can be quiet. You have to listen
          carefully for the sound of their
          footsteps -- because they may be
          closer than you think."
          Nearby, Selvig sits at a computer terminal, finishing up his
          e-mail. Beside him, a KID flips through a book with
          interest. The Librarian stops mid-story and calls to the Kid
          pleasantly.

          LIBRARIAN (CONT'D)
          Joshua, come sit down. It's story
          time.
          The Kid closes his book and joins the others. Selvig looks
          over, notices the title of the book the Kid was reading --

          "MYTHS AND LEGENDS FROM AROUND THE WORLD."
          He picks it up, flips through it, stops at the section on
          Scandinavian Mythology.
          It's a picture of a RAINBOW BRIDGE coming down from Asgard to
          earth. ASGARDIANS walk upon it, among them ODIN, LOKI, and
          THOR, who wields Mjolnir. On the ground below them, a group
          of VIKINGS kneel reverently.
          He eyes the illustration, pondering.

                          OMITTED 

           EXT. DESERT - DUSK 

          Jane's Pinzgauer cuts off the road, heads over the rugged
          terrain. Storm clouds roll in over the desert sky.

           INT. PINZGAUER - DUSK 

          Jane drives, pumped with adrenaline, nervous and excited, as
          Thor sits beside her, upbeat and eager for battle.



                         JANE
          I've never done anything like this
          before! Have you ever done
          anything like this before?
          Thor looks amused by her excitement.

                         THOR
          Many times. You're brave to do it.

                         JANE
          They just stole my entire life's
          work. I really don't have anything
          left to lose.

                         THOR
          But you're clever. Far more clever
          than anyone else in this Realm.

                         JANE
          "This Realm?" Why do you talk like
          that?

                         THOR
          You think me strange?
          Jane laughs, catches herself.

                         JANE
          Yeah. Just a little.

                         THOR
          Good strange or bad strange?

                         JANE
          I'm not quite sure yet.
          She looks at him, sees him staring at her. She's lost in his
          gaze, distracted, when the PINZGAUER LURCHES. She quickly
          turns her eyes forward, regains control of the car.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          Sorry.
          She glances back at him. He's confident, determined.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          Who are you? Really?

                         THOR
          You'll see soon enough.

                         JANE
          You promised me answers.

 B.
          Thor looks at her, charmed by her persistence.

                         THOR
          What you seek -- it's a bridge.

                         JANE
          A bridge? Like an Einstein-Rosen
          Bridge?

                         THOR
          More like a rainbow bridge.

 
          A beat.

                          JANE
          God, I hope you're not crazy.

          A EXT. DESERT - NIGHT A

          As the Pinzgauer heads away, we continue up a hillside,
          revealing a light illuminating the valley beyond. As we move
          closer, we see the glow comes from --

          A MASSIVE SHIELD BASE
          Now set up around the crater -- vehicles, trailers,
          barricades. Armed GUARDS man a gate in the razor wire fence
          that runs fifty yards from the crater's edge, enclosing the
          complex.
          Clear, plastic access tubes with junction boxes lead to a
          translucent cube structure erected in the middle of the
          crater.
          Through the glass walls of the base's command trailer, we see
          Coulson directing TECHNICIANS, busy at work.
          Within the cube structure itself, a team of SHIELD SCIENTISTS
          work with high-tech machinery, analyzing the object at the
          center of it all -- Mjolnir.

           EXT. RIDGE ABOVE CRATER - NIGHT 

          Jane and Thor crawl to the edge of the ridge, look through
          binoculars, see the impressive SHIELD base.

                         JANE
          That isn't a satellite crash. They
          would have hauled the wreckage
          away, not built a city around it.
          Thor shrugs out of his jacket and hands it to her.

                         THOR
          You're going to need this.

                         JANE
          Why?--
          Thunder RUMBLES overhead. She stares at him intently and
          takes his jacket.

                         THOR
          Stay here. Once I have Mjolnir, I
          will return what they stole from
          you.


          He looks to her, already knowing that Jane may disobey his
          request.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          Deal?

                         JANE
          No! Look what's down there! You
          can't just walk in, grab our stuff,
          and walk out!

                         THOR
          No.
          Jane looks relieved.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          I'm going to fly out.
          Before she can react, he starts heading towards the crater.
          The first drops of rain begin to patter into the dust.



                         JANE
          Wait...
          But Thor is already headed towards the crater.

          A EXT. SHIELD BASE / INT. HAMMER CONTAINMENT CUBE STRUCTURE A

          A NEEDLE spikes on a handheld SENSOR DEVICE. The TECHNICIAN
          holding it looks over at the hammer. Mjolnir begins to give
          off a subtle glow. A bolt of lightning CRACKS across the sky
          above.

                         CUT TO:

           AN AERIAL INFRARED VIDEO IMAGE OF THE AREA 
          It's fuzzy, doesn't show much. We widen to see we are:

           INT. SHIELD DESERT BASE - SECURITY ROOM 

          A younger SHIELD agent, a TECHIE in a headset, monitors
          security. AGENT SITWELL, humorless, just this side of
          junior, looks on, none-too-pleased.

                         TECHIE
          Feed from the keyhole. Can barely
          penetrate the cloud cover.
          The Techie hikes a thumb at another monitor, SQUELCHING with
          static. It shows an SAR shot of the area, laid over a
          terrain map.

          TECHIE (CONT'D)
          Tech's barely working as it is,
          with all the interference that
          thing's giving off.
          He gestures towards the hammer. He checks a computer.

          TECHIE (CONT'D)
          Hey, we've got a commercial
          aircraft coming in right over us,
          Southwest Airlines Flight .

                         SITWELL
          Reroute it, like all the others.

                         TECHIE
          Right. Can I get the passengers
          some free drinks for the trouble?
          Sitwell glares at him.



          TECHIE (CONT'D)

                         (SHRUGS)
          It'd be a nice gesture.
          The Techie types into the computer, when he notices something
          on another screen, holds up a hand.

          TECHIE (CONT'D)
          Hold a sec... we got something
          outside the fence, west side...
          He points at the screen. Through the haze, it shows a
          THERMAL IMAGE huddled beside the fence.

                         SITWELL
          (into a radio)
          DeLancey, Jackson -- check it out.

          A EXT. SHIELD DESERT BASE A

          A pair of SHIELD AGENTS (DELANCEY and JACKSON) take off in a
          jeep to investigate.

          B EXT. SHIELD SECURITY ROOM B

          Sitwell looks out the window, something strange catching his
          attention. We see in the window's reflection that a glow is
          coming from the hammer containment area.

           EXT. SHIELD DESERT BASE - FENCE - MOMENTS LATER 

          The jeep pulls up as the Agents scan the fence with a
          flashlight, see nothing unusual.

                         AGENT JACKSON

                         (INTO RADIO)
          Looks like we're good here. Must
          have been another coyote.
          Just then, the Agents notice a section of the fence has been
          bent up from the ground, leaving a gap.


          Before they can call it in, a massive CRACK OF LIGHTNING
          illuminates the night sky -- revealing the silhouette of a
          large man standing outside the driver's (Jackson's) side of
          the jeep. DeLancey looks over, notices.

                         AGENT DELANCEY
          Jackson?
          The Agents reach for their weapons. Thor elbows the driver
          across the jaw, causing him to drop his weapon. Jackson
          slumps over the steering wheel, as DeLancey starts to raise a
          shotgun at Thor.
          Thor grabs the barrel, yanks it out of DeLancey's hands and
          thrusts the hilt back, smashing the Agent's jaw.
          Thor reaches into the jeep to grab a rain slicker.

          A INT. SHIELD DESERT BASE - SECURITY A

          Sitwell talks into his radio, starting to look worried.

                         SITWELL

                         (INTO RADIO)
          DeLancey, Jackson -- report.

           EXT. SHIELD DESERT BASE - MOMENTS LATER 

          Thor, now wearing a SHIELD rain slicker, makes his way across
          the base.
          Another SHIELD AGENT approaches the jeep, spots the
          unconscious DeLancey and Jackson. He quickly calls into his
          radio.

          Sitwell holds his PDA -- even it's on the fritz. Sitwell and
          the Techie watch the monitors warily.
          On the monitor showing the hammer containment area, Mjolnir
          starts to crackle with energy.

          As Thor makes his way towards the crater, an alarm sounds and
          SECURITY LIGHTS explode to life.

          A EXT. RIDGE ABOVE CRATER A

          A spotlight fires out from the base and sweeps across the
          ridge towards Jane. She ducks down, out of sight.
          She pulls out her cellphone and dials. We hear Selvig's
          recorded message.

          SELVIG (V.O., ON PHONE)
          You've reached Dr. Erik Selvig.
          Please leave me a message.
          His voicemail BEEPS. She talks quietly, urgently.

                         JANE
          Erik, okay, first of all, don't
          worry. I'm perfectly fine, really.
          More sounds of MAYHEM come from the base.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          But if you don't hear from me
          again, you might want to come out
          to the crater site and look for me.
          I kind of did what you said I
          shouldn't do. Thanks. Bye.
          She hangs up.

           EXT. SHIELD DESERT BASE - COMMAND TRAILER 

          Coulson emerges from the SHIELD command trailer and marches
          across the mud, radio to his ear. He looks out across the
          lit up site uneasily.

 

           EXT. SHIELD DESERT BASE - NIGHT 

          A SHIELD GUARD moves through the base, rifle in hand. From
          the shadows behind a trailer, a FIGURE looks out at him.
          As the Guard raises his radio to check in, Thor quickly
          rushes towards him and chokes him out. He falls to the
          ground.
          Thor notices the AR- rifle lying on the ground beside the
          fallen Guard. He stares down at the weapon quizzically. As
          more GUARDS approach, Thor snatches up the weapon and takes
          cover in the shadows of the trailer. The Guards pass by.
          Thor peers around the corner, sees the well-guarded main
          entrance tube to the center of the site.
          A bright light suddenly illuminates his face. He looks to
          see an ATV moving across the site, shining its spotlight
          right on him.
          Thor sees that the ATV DRIVER has spotted him. The Driver
          raises his radio to report. Thor knows he has to act fact.
          He raises the rifle -- then flips it over in the air and
          catches it by the barrel. He rears the weapon back, then
          hurls it like a hammer. It flies through the air, smashing
          the ATV's spotlight.
          Glass and debris shower the driver, who takes his hands off
          the wheel to protect himself.
          The ATV roars out of control past the Guards near the tube
          entrance. The Guards notice and chase after it.
          Thor emerges from the shadows, watches the Guards abandoning
          the site entrance.

          A EXT. EDGE OF CRATER A

          The ATV Driver looks forward in panic as the ATV approaches
          the crater lip.
          The vehicle careens over the edge of the crater and heads
          straight for one of the plastic tunnels. The Technicians
          inside scatter as the ATV CRASHES into it, tearing into the
          tunnel, sending sparks everywhere.
          The ATV finally comes to a stop, the tunnel collapsing around
          it and the Driver. SHIELD AGENTS rush in behind to help.

           Jane peers over the ridge, stares down at the frenzied
           aftermath of the ATV crash, at the base on high alert.
           Lightning CRACKS in the sky behind her.

          He's not pleased. The light rain becomes a downpour.

          C EXT. MAIN ENTRANCE TUBE C

          As SHIELD Agents pull the ATV driver from the wreckage, Thor
          races towards the unguarded entrance to the tunnels and heads
          inside.

          Thor races up the entrance ramp. Before him, two GUARDS
          round the corner.
          Thor knocks out the first Guard, then tackles the second. He
          hurries around the corner, when more GUARDS come up a ladder
          ahead. Thor punches the closest Guard, sending him tumbling
          backwards, toppling the others on the ladder behind him.
          Thor takes off running, as the Guards regroup and give chase.
          Thor spots the glow of Mjolnir in the central cube, through
          the translucent walls of the tunnels. He hurries through to
          tunnels to find a way towards it.

          As Thor races through the tunnel, a GUARD runs right at him,
          on a collision course. Thor takes him out with a punch to
          the gut, then turns to see more AGENTS coming towards him.
          Thor picks up the fallen Guard he punched, then throws him
          into the approaching Agents, scattering them.
          Thor turns around, runs back the way he came. The Agents
          give chase.

          distance to the target. He locks in on Thor, who's inside

          heading towards the cube structure.

          Thor races through the tunnel, comes across a wall of AGENTS.
          Thor ROARS and barrels through them -- elbowing, punching --
          whatever it takes to keep moving.
          As he takes down the last Agent, Thor sees the last junction
          box and the entrance to the cube structure up ahead.
          He races towards it. He can actually see Mjolnir within the
          middle of the structure, when -- BAM! From out of nowhere, a
          fist lands a powerful blow across his jaw, sending him
          reeling. Dazed, Thor looks up to see --

          A HUGE SHIELD AGENT
          The biggest of them all, standing between him and his hammer
          in the cube structure beyond. Thor sizes him up.

                         THOR
           You're big.

          electrical storm erupting inside the structure ahead,
          directly above the crater... and the hammer.

          Thor and the Huge Agent struggle to stand in the mud.
          Through the translucent walls of the cube structure, Thor
          sees Mjolnir. The Huge Agent rises up before him, blocking
          his view.
          Rain and blood run down Thor's face. He lunges forward,
          whipping his feet in front of him, then kicks out, nailing
          the Huge Agent in the chest. The Agent goes down hard as
          Thor's momentum carries him past.
          Thor stands, heads for the cube structure, when the Huge
          Guard grabs his ankle in a last effort. Thor looks back down
          at his foe, then drops backwards, pile driving his elbow into
          the fallen Agent's chest. The Huge Agent grimaces in pain,
          defeated.
          Thor races back towards the structure.

          From outside, Thor rips an opening in the plastic wall of the

          He stands there -- soaking, bleeding, caked with wet earth.
          His hammer rests just a few yards before him, energy surging
          around it.
          Coulson steps into the structure through an access tunnel,
          one story up.

          As Thor approaches his hammer, Mjolnir starts to glow
          brighter, blue electricity sparking off its surface. The
          crackling energy seems to reach out to him. Coulson notices,
          his interest piqued.
          Above the open ceiling of the structure, Barton's crane
          bucket comes into view.

          Wind and rain whip around Barton as he stares into his rifle

          trigger.

          Thor stands next to the hammer, feels its power. He reaches
          out to it confidently.
          Coulson watches from above. Armed AGENTS approach behind
          him. He motions for them to hold their positions, then
          radios Barton.

          Coulson watches Thor with anticipation as Thor wraps his hand
          around the hammer. He smiles, triumphant, lifts... but the
          hammer doesn't move.
          Thor looks confused, tries again with two hands, to no avail
          -- anger and frustration overtaking him. He strains with all
          his might, SCREAMS from the effort, bellowing up at the storm
          and lightning above him.
          Something begins to appear on the side of Mjolnir -- glowing
          RUNES. Thor looks down, sees them.
          But, still, the hammer doesn't budge. Thor falls to his
          knees before it, rain pouring down around him, as the glowing
          runes fade away. He's failed. Unworthy.
          Coulson looks on, disappointed.
          SHIELD AGENTS move in, guns trained on Thor, surrounding him.
          Coulson activates his radio.

          over.
          As the Agents surround him, Thor doesn't seem to notice or
          care. He just sits there on his knees, head bowed in the
          rain -- a man broken, lost.
          From overhead, we see the hammer in the cube containment
          room. We pull up as the Guards approach Thor, then continue
          to climb, until we see the whole camp -- and the extensive
          damage Thor's done to it during the melee.

                         (THEN)
          The men you so easily subdued are
          highly-trained professionals, and
          in my experience, it takes someone
          who's received similar training to
          do what you did to them. Would you
          like to tell me where you received
          your training?
          Thor sits silently.

          COULSON (CONT'D)
          Pakistan? Chechnya? Afghanistan?
          Then again, you strike me more as
          the soldier of fortune type. What
          was it, South Africa?
          Still no answer. Coulson leans in close to him.

          COULSON (CONT'D)
          Certain groups pay well for a good
          mercenary. Especially HYDRA.
          Coulson waits for a response, but gets none.

          COULSON (CONT'D)
          Who are you?



                         THOR
          Just a man.

                         COULSON
          One way or another, we find out
          what we want to know. We're good
          at that.
          Coulson leaves the room. Thor lowers his head.

          LOKI (O.S.)
          I thought he'd never leave.
          Thor looks up, shocked to find Loki standing there, dressed
          in st century attire.

                         THOR
          Loki? What are you doing here?

                         LOKI
          I had to see you.

                         THOR
          What's happened? Tell me! Is it
          Jotunheim? Let me explain to

                         FATHER--

                         LOKI
          Father is dead.
          Thor stares at him, stunned.

                         THOR
          What?

                         LOKI
          Your banishment, the threat of a
          new war, it was too much for him to
          bear.
          The implications of Loki's words dawn on Thor -- he's
          responsible for his father's fate. Loki draws close to him,
          looks in his eyes, consolingly.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          You mustn't blame yourself. I know
          that you loved him. I tried to
          tell him so, but he wouldn't
          listen.

                         (MORE)

 

           LOKI (CONT'D)

                         (THEN)
          It was cruel to put the hammer
          within your reach, knowing you
          could never lift it.
          Thor stares ahead, falling deeper into the abyss.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          The burden of the throne has fallen
          to me now.

                         THOR
          Can I come home?

                         LOKI
          The truce with Jotunheim is
          conditional upon your exile.

                         THOR
          But couldn't we find a way to--

                         LOKI
          Mother has forbidden your return.
          Thor nods, lowers his head, beaten.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          This is goodbye, brother. I'm so
          sorry.

                         THOR
          No, I'm sorry. Loki... thank you
          for coming here.

                         LOKI
          Nothing could have stopped me.
          Coulson enters the room, but seems to take no notice of Loki.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          Fare well, brother.

                         THOR
          Good-bye.

                         COULSON
          Good-bye? I just got back.
          Thor looks up to see that Loki is gone.

          COULSON (CONT'D)
          Now. Where did we leave off?

 

           EXT. CRATER - NIGHT 

          Agents and Scientists work to repair the damaged area around
          Mjolnir. They take no notice of Loki as he steps up beside
          the hammer. He stares at it -- intrigued, wondering. Can he
          do it?
          He reaches down, tries to lift it -- but can't. He lets it
          go, eyes it with contempt, then steps away.
          He gestures with his arms. An odd GREEN AND GOLD LIGHT rises
          from the ground, enveloping him, then he disappears.

           INT. HOLDING CELL - NIGHT 

          Sitwell enters and speaks sotto to Coulson.

                         SITWELL

                         (RE: THOR)
          Sir... he's got a visitor.

 

           INT. SECURITY ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 

          Coulson and several other SHIELD AGENTS stand across from
          Erik Selvig.

                         COULSON
          "Donald Blake?"

                         SELVIG
          Doctor Donald Blake. He's part of
          our team.

                         COULSON
          You have dangerous coworkers, Dr.
          Selvig.

                         SELVIG
          Troubled, not dangerous. He was
          distraught when he found out that
          you'd taken all of our research.
          It was years of his life, gone! He
          got depressed, started drinking,
          and... well, you know the rest.

                         COULSON
          Uh-huh. You mind if we take a
          moment to verify his identity?

                         SELVIG
          Certainly.
          The Techie at a computer nearby runs the name.

          SELVIG (CONT'D)
          You can understand how a man could
          go off like that. I mean, a big,
          faceless organization like yours,
          coming in with their jack-booted
          thugs and stealing private
          property...

                         (THEN)
          ...is how he described it.

                         COULSON
          That doesn't explain how he managed
          to tear through our security.
          Selvig shrugs.

                         SELVIG
          Steroids. He's a bit of a fitness
          nut.


          On the Techie's monitor, a DMV record from the State of New
          York pops up reading "DR. DONALD BLAKE". The license photo
          is indeed a picture of Thor -- the one Darcy took with her
          cellphone.


          The Techie hits a button, and a graphic reads, "SHIELD
          SECURITY ANALYSIS IN PROGRESS." Coulson eyes the screen.
          After a beat, he turns back to Selvig.

                         COULSON
          It says here he's an M.D.

                         SELVIG
          He is. That is, he was. He
          switched careers and became a
          physicist. He's quite brilliant,
          really.

                         (THEN)
          If you would just release him to
          me, I promise to keep an eye on
          him.
          Coulson thinks, sizing Selvig up -- then smiles. He turns to
          an AGENT nearby.

                         COULSON
          Release Dr. Blake to Dr. Selvig
          here.
          The Techie looks to him, surprised.

          COULSON (CONT'D)

                         (TO SELVIG)
          Make sure he stays in town for the
          next few days in case we need to
          talk to him again.
          Selvig shakes his hand.

                         SELVIG
          Thank you.

          A INT. SHIELD HOLDING CELL - NIGHT A

          Selvig bursts into the room with a SHIELD Agent to find a
          seated Thor.

                         SELVIG
          Donny, Donny, Donny! There you
          are!
          Thor looks up, unsure what the hell is going on. Selvig
          pulls Thor to his feet, gives him a warm hug.

          SELVIG (CONT'D)
          It's going to be all right, my
          friend. Come on, I'm taking you
          home.


          He leads the bewildered Thor out the door.

          B EXT. COULSON'S TRAILER - NIGHT B

          As Thor and Selvig make their way past the SHIELD Security
          Room, Thor notices Jane's possessions and equipment from the
          Smith Motors lab stacked under a tarp. He spots Jane's hand-
          written journal among them. As he passes, he quickly takes
          it from the pile and pockets it.

          C INT. SECURITY ROOM - NIGHT C

          Coulson looks at the computer bearing Donald Blake's DMV
          record. A security warning over the image clearly reads
          "SECURITY ALERT: FALSIFIED DATA." He knows it's been a ruse
          all along.
          He looks to Selvig and Thor heading away from the Security
          Room, then follows them outside.

           EXT. SHIELD DESERT BASE - NIGHT 

          Coulson and two SHIELD Agents watch as Selvig walks with Thor
          away from the base to the SUV. Coulson calls to Selvig.

                         COULSON
          Just keep him away from the bars.

                         SELVIG
          I will!

                         THOR

                         (TO SELVIG)
          Where are we going?
          Selvig drops his cool demeanor.

                         SELVIG
          To get a drink.
          Selvig and Thor climb into the SUV.
          As they drive off, Coulson turns to the other two agents --
          GARRETT and CALE.

                         COULSON
          Follow them.

 

           EXT. JOTUNHEIM - DAY 

          Loki, looking apprehensive, walks alone across the icy
          surface of the planet.

           INT. LAUFEY'S TEMPLE - DAY 

          Darkness shrouds the ruined temple, save for the shafts of
          light which knife their way in through the damaged ceiling.
          Loki enters. Frost Giant guards surround him on all sides.
          Laufey approaches, towers over him menacingly.

                         LAUFEY
          Tell me why I shouldn't kill you.

                         LOKI
          I've come alone and unarmed.

                         LAUFEY
          To what end?

                         LOKI
          To make you another proposition.

                         LAUFEY

                         (REALIZING)
          So you're the one who let us into
          Asgard.

                         LOKI
          You're welcome.

                         LAUFEY
          My men are dead, and I have no
          Casket. You are a deceiver.
          Laufey lashes out, grabs Loki around the throat, but Loki
          calmly stands his ground.

                         LOKI
          You have no idea what I am.
          The blueness spreads across his face, as Laufey and the
          guards stare in shock. Loki grins.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          Hello, Father.
          Laufey releases him. Loki's body turns back to normal.
          Intrigued, Laufey sizes up his son.



                         LAUFEY
          Ah, the bastard son. I thought
          Odin had killed you. That's what I
          would have done. He's as weak as
          you are.

                         LOKI
          No longer weak. I now rule Asgard,
          until Odin awakens. Perhaps you
          should not have so carelessly
          abandoned me.
          This gives Laufey pause.

                         LAUFEY
          Or perhaps it was the wisest choice
          I've ever made. I will hear you.



                         LOKI
          I will conceal you and a handful of
          your soldiers, lead you into his
          chambers, and let you slay him
          where he lies. I'll keep the
          throne, and you will have the
          Casket.
          Laufey studies Loki's face.

                         LAUFEY
          Why would you do this?

                         LOKI
          When all is done, we will have a
          permanent peace between our two
          worlds. Then I, the bastard son,
          will have accomplished what Odin
          and Thor never could.

                         LAUFEY
          This is a great day for Jotunheim.
          Asgard is finally ours.

                         LOKI
          No. Asgard is mine. The rest of
          the Nine Realms will be yours, if
          you do as you're told.
          Laufey considers the proposition.

                         LAUFEY
          I accept.
          Loki turns to leave. As he goes, the slightest trace of a
          smile crosses his face.

           INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY - DAY 

          Loki emerges out of the Bifrost, as Heimdall steps away from
          his controls. Heimdall glares at Loki. Loki notices.

                         LOKI
          What troubles you, Gatekeeper?



                         HEIMDALL
          I turned my gaze upon you in
          Jotunheim, but could neither see
          nor hear you. You were shrouded
          from me, like the Frost Giants who
          entered this Realm.

                         LOKI
          Perhaps your senses have weakened
          after your many years of service.

                         HEIMDALL
          Or perhaps someone has found a way
          to hide that which he does not wish
          me to see.
          Loki sizes him up, smiles.

                         LOKI
          You have great power, Heimdall.
          Tell me, did Odin ever fear you?

                         HEIMDALL
          No.

                         LOKI
          And why is that?

                         HEIMDALL
          Because he is my King, and I am
          sworn to obey him.

                         LOKI
          Exactly. Just as you're sworn to
          obey me now. Yes?
          A beat.

                         HEIMDALL
          Yes.

                         LOKI
          Good. Then you will open the
          Bifrost to no one until I have
          undone what my brother has started.
          Loki heads out of the Observatory. Heimdall stares after
          him.

 

           INT. BAR - NIGHT 

          Thor and Selvig sit at a booth at the back of the local dive.
          The bartender sets down a couple mugs of beer and two shots
          of whiskey. Selvig pours the shot into his mug and downs it.
          Thor follows his example.



                         SELVIG
          Seems Darcy's a terrible intern,
          but a talented hacker.

                         THOR
          Thank you for what you've done.

                         SELVIG
          Don't thank me. I only did it for 
          Jane.

                         THOR
          Are you in love with her?

                         SELVIG
          Of course not! Jane's like a
          daughter to me. Her father and I
          taught at University together. A
          good man, but he never listened.
          This registers with Thor.

                         THOR
          Neither did I.
          Selvig eyes him with interest.

                         SELVIG
          I don't know if you're really 
          delusional, and I really don't care 
          at this point. I just care about 
          her. I've seen the way she looks
          at you.

                         THOR
          I swear to you, I mean her no harm.

                         SELVIG
          Good. If that's the case, then
          I'll buy you one more drink, and 
          you'll leave town tonight. 
          A long pause, then Thor nods. He takes a drink.

 .

                         THOR
          I had it all backwards. I had it
          all wrong.
          Selvig watches him keenly. This is a different Thor than
          he's seen before.

                         SELVIG
          It's not a bad thing, finding out
          that you don't have all the
          answers. That's when you start
          asking the right questions.
          Thor takes this in.

                         THOR
          For the first time in my life, I
          have no idea what I'm supposed to
          do. 

                         SELVIG
          Anyone who's ever going to find 
          their way in this world has to
          start by admitting they don't know
          where the hell they are.
          Thor nods.

          DRUNK TOWNIE (O.S.)
          Hey, I know you, man... 
          An intimidating DRUNK TOWNIE nearby sizes up Thor. He is one 
          of the Townies from Isabela's Diner who saw Thor earlier. He
          approaches, belligerent and looking for a fight. 

          DRUNK TOWNIE (CONT'D)
          You were in the diner with that hot 
          girl.
          Thor doesn't like where this is going. 

          DRUNK TOWNIE (CONT'D)
          I wouldn't mind her doing a little
          research on me.
          He laughs. Thor is annoyed. 

                         THOR
          I have no quarrel with you. But 
          she's a lady. You should be more 
          respectful.

 

                          DRUNK TOWNIE
           And you should shut the hell up, 
           princess.
           Selvig looks to Thor, concerned that he's going to lose it. 
           But, to his surprise, Thor remains unaffected by the Townie's 
          baiting. 

                          THOR 
           I will not fight him. 

                          DRUNK TOWNIE 
           Then it'll be easy to kick your 
           ass. 
           Selvig stands, steps between the two men.

                          SELVIG
           Gentlemen, please. Let's keep our 
           heads. 
          Just then, Selvig HEAD-BUTTS the Townie, knocking him out.
          Thor's impressed. Selvig downs his drink, then hurls his
          glass aside, SHATTERING it on the ground.



          SELVIG (CONT'D)

                         (TO THOR)
          Another drink?

           EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT 

          Thor and Selvig stumble down the street, singing a NORWEGIAN
          FOLK SONG. They improvise an impromptu drinking song dance
          routine involving side steps and happy slaps, optimistically
          in time with the song.

                         THOR/SELVIG

                         (SINGING)
          "The mood is good, our hearts are
          full, there's magic in the air. /
          It's all because we're here
          tonight, and haven't got a care. /
          So raise a glass, and toast to
          life, wherever it may lead / Tra-la-
          la, tra-la-la, a friend is fine
          indeed. / Tra-la-la, tra-la-la, a
          friend is fine indeed!"
          Thor holds up a hand for Selvig's last finishing slap.
          Selvig misses it completely and falls out of frame like a
          straight dead weight with a CLUNK.
          WIDE SHOT. Emerging from behind the car where Selvig fell,
          Thor stands up, Selvig slung over his shoulder, and starts to
          walk up the street towards Jane's trailer.

           INT. JANE'S TRAILER - NIGHT 

          The small trailer is in a state of perpetual disarray, strewn
          with various books, old pizza boxes, etc. A worried Jane
          lies on her bed, trying to read.
          She's startled by the loud RAPPING on the door. She bolts to
          the door and opens it to find --

                         THOR
          Standing there with the unconscious Selvig slung over his
          shoulder.

                         JANE
          Erik!

                         (TO THOR)
          Is he all right?

                         THOR
          He's fine. Not injured at all.


          As Thor enters, he BANGS Selvig's head on the doorway.
          Selvig GROANS.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          Sorry, my friend.

                         JANE
          What happened?

                         THOR
          We drank. We fought. He made his
          ancestors proud.



                         JANE
          Put him on the bed.
          Thor moves through the small trailer carrying Selvig, like a
          bear lugging another bear, smashing into things along the
          way, until he finally sets Selvig down on Jane's bed. Selvig
          awakens groggily and looks up at him through bleary eyes.

                         SELVIG
          I still don't believe you're the
          God of Thunder.

                         (THEN)
          But you ought to be.
          Thor grins, pats him on the cheek. As Selvig drifts off to
          sleep, Thor pulls a blanket over him.
          Jane watches, stunned by their friendship, impressed by
          Thor's tenderness. Thor turns back to her, looks around.

                         THOR
          These are your chambers?
          Jane suddenly becomes self-conscious. She starts cleaning up
          the mess around her.

                         JANE
          Well, it's more of a temporary
          living space, really. I don't
          usually have visitors in here.
          Actually, never...
          Thor picks up a sock off the floor. She snatches it from
          him, puts it away.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          Can we go outside?

           EXT. SMITH MOTORS - ROOF - NIGHT 

          Thor steps off a ladder onto the roof of Smith Motors. He
          offers Jane his hand, helps her up. There's a telescope set
          up, a couple chairs, some blankets.

                         JANE
          I come up here sometimes when I
          can't sleep. Or when I'm trying to
          reconcile particle data. Or when
          Darcy's driving me crazy.

                         (THEN)
          I come up here a lot, now that I
          think about it.
          Thor looks at the night sky, filled with stars.



          JANE (CONT'D)
          I'm glad you're safe.

                         THOR
          You've been very kind. I've been
          far less grateful than you deserve.

                         JANE
          I also hit you with my car a couple
          times, so it kind of evens out.
          He grins, then reaches into his pocket and pulls out her

          NOTEBOOK.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          I don't believe it...
          She takes it from him, surprised and grateful.

                         THOR
          It was all I could get back. Not
          as much as I promised. I'm sorry.

                         JANE
          No, this is good. Thank you. This
          means I don't have to start from
          scratch...
          She sits down and opens the notebook eagerly, then stops, a
          harsh realization clouding her face. Thor notices.

                         THOR
          What's wrong?

                         JANE
          SHIELD, whatever they are. They're
          never going to let this research
          see the light of day.

                         THOR
          You must do this. You must finish
          what you've started.

                         JANE
          Why?

                         THOR
          Because you're right. It's taken
          so many generations for your people
          to get to this point. You're
          nearly there. You just need
          someone to show you how close you
          really are.


          Thor moves beside her, opens her notebook, turns to the page
          which bears a sketch of the Bifrost. He takes the pen from
          the notebook, begins to add to the sketch, leading from one
          point to another in space.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          Look -- your ancestors called it
          magic. You call it science. I
          come from a place where they're one
          and the same thing.
          We recognize that Thor is drawing the branches of Yggdrasil
          as she looks on, amazed and intrigued.

                         JANE
          What is it?

                         THOR
          This is how my father explained it
          to me...

                         (THEN)
          Your world is one of the Nine
          Realms of the Cosmos, linked to
          each other by the branches of
          Yggdrasil, the Worlds Tree. Now,
          you see it every day, without
          realizing. Images glimpsed through
          -- what did you call it?...
          (checks her notebook)
          ...this Hubble Telescope. So, Nine
          Realms...
          They look at each other. She nods. They smile. This is
          going to be a long night.

           EXT. SMITH MOTORS - ROOF - LATER 

          Jane sleeps beside Thor on the blankets on the rooftop. He
          stares up at the night sky.
          She rolls close to him, nuzzles against him in her sleep. He
          looks down at her, beautiful in the moonlight, looks out at
          the town beyond her.

           INT. HEALING ROOM - DAY 

          Volstagg eats ravenously from a PLATTER OF FOOD. Sif stands
          nearby, ill at ease. Fandral watches Volstagg incredulously
          as the large warrior stuffs himself. Finally Fandral can
          stand it no more.



                         FANDRAL
          Our dearest friend banished, Loki
          on the throne, Asgard on the brink
          of war, yet you manage to consume
          four wild boar, six pheasant, a
          side of beef, and two casks of ale.
          Shame on you! Don't you care?!
          Fandral moves to throw the platter in the fire, but Volstagg
          pulls his weapon, stopping him.

                         VOLSTAGG
          Do not mistake my appetite for
          apathy.

                         SIF
          Stop it, both of you! We all know
          what we have to do, we're just too
          damned afraid to do it!

                         HOGUN

                         (DECIDES)
          We must go. We must find Thor.
          Hogun starts to pull the delicate HEALING STONES from the
          fire, carefully putting them into a POUCH at his side.

                         FANDRAL
          It's treason, Hogun.

                         VOLSTAGG
          To hell with treason, it's suicide.

                         (SUDDENLY NERVOUS)
          Now, shh! Heimdall may be
          watching! It's said he can hear--

                         FANDRAL
          Yes, yes, we know!

                         SIF
          Thor would do the same for us.
          An EINHERJAR GUARD enters. They tense.

                         EINHERJAR GUARD
          Heimdall demands your presence.
          Volstagg quickly drains his flagon of ale.

                         VOLSTAGG
          We're doomed.

 

           EXT. MAIN STREET - MORNING 

          Dawn breaks over the quiet town of Puente Antiguo.

           EXT. SMITH MOTORS - ROOF - DAY 

          Thor awakens, looks down to see Jane still sleeping, nuzzled
          against him. She opens her eyes, looks up at him and smiles.


          He stands, offers his hand, helps her to her feet.

           EXT. SMITH MOTORS - LAB 

          Thor helps Jane down off a ladder. A groggy, hungover Selvig
          emerges from Jane's trailer. He sees Thor with Jane.
          Selvig eyes the two of them together, then:

                         SELVIG
          I need some coffee.
          The three head inside Smith Motors.

          FROM THE LIBRARY ROOFTOP ACROSS THE STREET
          SHIELD Agents Garrett and Cale watch the scene, pointing a
          small audio surveillance device towards the lab.

          A INT. SMITH MOTORS - LAB - DAY A

          Darcy and Selvig sit at a card table, drinking coffee. Thor
          holds a couple plates as Jane makes eggs on a hotplate. She
          scoops them out onto the plates. Thor takes them over to the
          table, sets them down before Selvig and Darcy.

                         DARCY
          Thanks.

                         THOR
          You're very welcome.
          Jane joins them at the card table with a couple more plates.
          She and Thor sit with the others and start to eat their
          breakfast, looking like a little family.

          On a roof across the street from Smith Motors, Agents Garrett
          and Cale continue their surveillance, bored out of their
          wits. Agent Cale watches the group through the lab window
          with binoculars. Agent Garrett listens to his comm-link,
          turns to Cale.

                         AGENT GARRETT
          They want an update.

                         AGENT CALE
          Tell them he's eating eggs.

                         AGENT GARRETT
          Scrambled or fried?
          Cale glares at him.

                         (INTO COMM-LINK)

          We'll keep you posted.

          As the group finishes breakfast, Thor looks at the mug in his
          hand, gets an idea.

                         THOR

                         (RE: MUG)
          May I have this?

                         DARCY
          Sure.

                         THOR
          Thank you. Excuse me a moment.
          Thor leaves.

          A EXT. MAIN STREET - MOMENTS LATER A

          In front of her diner, Isabela prepares to open for the day.
          (Through the window of Isabela's, we see chairs still atop
          tables.) Isabela sweeps the front porch.
          She looks up to see Thor approaching. She eyes him
          suspiciously. He offers her a MUG.

                         THOR
          To replace the one I broke. Please
          forgive my behavior.


          She takes it, looks at it curiously, then smiles at him.

                         ISABEL
          Okay. Thank you.

                         THOR
          If I may, I'd like to come back for
          more of your "coffee."

                         ISABEL
          Any time.
          He nods and walks away. She stares after him, smiling, and
          shrugs.

          ISABEL (CONT'D)
          She could do worse.

           INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY - DAY 

          Sif and the Warriors Three enter warily to find the
          intimidating Heimdall standing before the Observatory's
          controls. He glares at them accusingly.

                         VOLSTAGG
          Good Heimdall, less us explain--

                         HEIMDALL
          You would defy the commands of Loki
          our King, break every oath you have
          taken as warriors, and commit
          treason to bring Thor back?
          The four exchange nervous glances.

                         SIF
          Yes, but--

                         HEIMDALL
          Good.
          The group looks puzzled. What did he just say?

                         VOLSTAGG
          So you'll help us?

                         HEIMDALL
          I am bound by honor to our King. I
          cannot open the Bifrost to you.
          With that, Heimdall leaves them alone in the Observatory.
          The others exchange puzzled looks.

 B.

                         FANDRAL
          Complicated fellow, isn't he?

                         VOLSTAGG
          Now what do we do?
          Sif glances at the control panel, notices something.

                         SIF
          Look!
          The others turn to see HEIMDALL'S SWORD stuck into the
          control panel. They exchange a grin. They have an ally.
          Sif hits the controls, and the Bifrost apparatus fires up.

           INT. SHIELD DESERT BASE - SECURITY ROOM - DAY 

          Coulson races in as a SHIELD TECHIE calls up satellite
          footage of the Bifrost storm on a monitor.

                         COULSON
          What the hell was that?



                         TECHIE
          I don't know, sir. We got massive
          energy readings out of nowhere,
          then they just disappeared.
          Fifteen miles due northwest.

                         COULSON
          Let's go take a look.

           EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) - DAY 

          Amidst the fury of the Bifrost storm, the Warriors Three and
          Sif drop to the ground in the New Mexico desert. They
          clamber to their feet as the Bifrost quickly recedes, the
          hole in the sky closing up behind it. The Bifrost runes
          cover the desert sand around them.

                         VOLSTAGG
          He must have landed nearby. It's
          time to put our tracking skills to
          work. Spread out. Check the sand
          for indentations of his boot
          prints.

                         FANDRAL
          The winds would have blown them
          away by now. We should look for
          signs of a campfire.

                         SIF
          Or we could just start there.
          She points behind them to the town of Puente Antiguo in the
          distance -- the only visible sign of civilization -- and to
          Hogun, who has already started walking towards it. Volstagg
          and Fandral trade looks, their egos bruised.

                         FANDRAL
          It's worth a look, I suppose.
          The party tromps towards the town.

           EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY 

           Townsfolk stare in wonder at the Warriors Three and Sif, as
           they stroll down the street in all their Asgardian splendor.

           EXT. DOWN THE STREET - DAY 

           A BOY Hits a baseball, which rolls under a parked car. He
           runs to retrieve it, but can't reach it. Suddenly, the side 
           of the CAR rises into the air. The boy looks over, his mouth 
           dropping open at what he sees. Volstagg easily holds the car 
           up with one hand. 

 
           Volstagg picks up the boy's ball, then drops the car. He 
           hands the ball back to the boy, tousling his hair. 

                          VOLSTAGG 
           There you go, lad!
           The boy just stares, standing frozen. The Asgardians head 
          off.

          VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)
          Is it just me, or does Earth look a
          little different to you?

                         SIF
          It has been a thousand years...

                         VOLSTAGG
          Things change so fast here. You
          leave for a millennium, and it's
          like the whole neighborhood's gone.
          Volstagg sniffs, smells something.

          VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)
          Perhaps we should split up.

           EXT. PUENTE ANTIGUO - ROOFTOP - DAY 



          Agents Cale and Garrett spot Sif, Fandral, and Hogun walking
          down the street.

                         AGENT GARRETT
          Is there a Renaissance Faire in
          town?

                         AGENT CALE
          Call it in.
          But before they can, Volstagg rises up behind them, smashes
          their heads together. They're out.

                         VOLSTAGG
          Never cared for spies.
          He starts to go, then sees their bag of fast food on the
          ground. Intrigued, he pulls out a cheeseburger and takes a
          bite. He likes what he tastes.

          VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)
          Exquisite.

           EXT. PALACE GROUNDS - DAY 

          Loki stands with Gungnir, surveying his kingdom, when an
          Einherjar Guard quickly approaches him, out of breath.

                         EINHERJAR GUARD
          My liege, the Warriors Three and
          the Lady Sif have gone missing.
          Loki reacts. He knows who's responsible.

           EXT. RAINBOW BRIDGE - DAY 

          Loki approaches Heimdall on the Rainbow Bridge.

                         HEIMDALL
          Tell me, Loki, how did you get the
          Jotuns into Asgard?

                         LOKI
          You think the Bifrost is the only
          way in and out of the Realm? There
          are secret paths between worlds to
          which even you with all your gifts
          are blind. But I have need of them
          no longer, now that I am King.

                         (THEN)
          And I say, for your act of treason,
          you are relieved of your duties as
          Gatekeeper. And you are no longer
          a citizen of Asgard.

 .

                         HEIMDALL
          Then I need no longer obey you.
          Heimdall raises his massive sword, strides towards Loki.
          Loki reaches out and, with both hands, takes hold of
          something invisible, hovering in mid-air before him. As it
          quickly fades into view, we realize what it is --

          THE CASKET OF ANCIENT WINTERS.
          The blueness creeps from his hands and up his arms, as Loki
          opens the Casket towards Heimdall, who is fast approaching.
          From inside the Casket, all hell breaks loose. The fury of
          the Casket is unleashed, its winds not just howling, but
          SCREAMING, as ice and snow and darkness come flying straight
          towards Heimdall. Ice clings to his body, freezing him, but
          still he moves forward. Loki starts to get worried.
          Heimdall is nearly upon him. The Gatekeeper swings his
          massive sword at the prince. But the blade STOPS, frozen,
          just inches from Loki's throat. Loki breathes a sigh of
          relief and steps past him.

           INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY - DAY 

          Loki inserts Gungnir into the Observatory's control panel and
          opens the Bifrost. He gestures, and the veiled DESTROYER
          appears before him, a fiery glow rising within it. It turns
          its head toward its King.

                         LOKI
          Ensure my brother does not return.

           INT. SMITH MOTORS - LAB - DAY 

           Jane, Thor, Darcy, and Selvig make a charming team, tidying
           up after breakfast -- washing, drying, and putting plates and
          utensils away.
          The door opens.

           VOLSTAGG (O.S.)
           Found you!
          Thor, Jane, Selvig, and Darcy turn to see --

          SIF AND THE WARRIORS THREE
          Staring baffled at the sight of the domestic Thor drying
          dishes in mortal clothing.
          Jane drops a plate. It goes SHATTERING on the floor.



                         THOR
          My friends!
          Thor happily races over and greets his comrades.
          Jane, Selvig, and Darcy watch the Asgardians from across the
          room. Jane looks concerned. Selvig and Darcy eye them with
          wonder.

                         SELVIG
          I don't believe it...

                         DARCY
          Who are they?



                         VOLSTAGG
          Lady Sif and the Warriors Three.
          Surely you've heard tales of Hogun
          the Grim, Fandral the Dashing, and
          I, Volstagg the Svelte?
          Selvig looks pointedly at Volstagg's massive gut.

          VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)
          Well, perhaps I've put on a little
          more muscle since I was here last.

                         JANE 
          That would have been a thousand 
          years ago? Northern Europe? 

                         VOLSTAGG 
          Exactly! Those lovely herring 
          people. They worshipped us! 
          Thor grins, lays a hand on Volstagg's shoulder.

                         THOR
          My friends, I've never been happier 
          to see anyone. But you should not
          have come.

                         FANDRAL
          We're here to take you home.
          Jane reacts to the news of Thor leaving.

                         THOR
          You know I can't. My father is 
          dead because of me. I must remain
          in exile.
          The other Asgardians exchange puzzled looks.

                         SIF
          Thor... your father still lives.
          Thor reacts to the revelation.

           EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) - DAY 

          A few SHIELD vehicles are parked by the Bifrost site. A few
          SHIELD agents stand nearby as SCIENTISTS take readings.
          Coulson kneels, examines the Bifrost Runes. He turns to an
          Agent.



                         COULSON
          Get somebody from Linguistics out
          here.
          Just then, they hear a RUMBLING overhead, as the Bifrost
          storm ROARS in the sky above.
          Coulson and the SHIELD Agents scramble for cover, their
          vehicle windshields SHATTERING, as the Bifrost storm grows in
          strength. Finally, the hole in the sky overhead opens, and
          the funnel cloud EXPLODES out of it, touching down onto the
          desert floor.
          Coulson and the Agents shelter their eyes from the maelstrom.

          Was somebody else coming?
          Just then, the Bifrost funnel EXPLODES down to the ground.

           EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) - DAY 

          From behind a jeep, Coulson and the SHIELD AGENTS stare at
          the Destroyer in awe. We don't see it, just its shadow as it
          moves towards them.

                         SHIELD AGENT

                         (RE: DESTROYER)
          Is that one of Stark's?

                         COULSON
          I don't think so. But the guy
          doesn't tell me anything.


          Coulson grabs a megaphone, steps forward, calls out to the
          Destroyer.

          COULSON (CONT'D)
          Hello! You're using unregistered
          weapons technology. Please
          identify yourself.
          We hear the HUM of the Destroyer's fiery energy power up
          inside.

          COULSON (CONT'D)
          Incoming!
          As the SHIELD Agents scramble for cover, a blast of energy
          from the Destroyer EXPLODES a vehicle. SHIELD agents return
          fire.

           EXT. SMITH MOTORS - DAY 

          Townspeople fill the streets, staring at the fire fight in
          the distance. Thor and the Asgardians prepare for battle, as
          Thor turns to Jane.

                         THOR
          Leave this town now. Get yourself
          and your friends to safety.

                         JANE
          What about you?

                         THOR
          I must stay and fight.
          The Asgardians look to Thor.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          I'm still a warrior, and I will
          fight by your side.

                         VOLSTAGG
          You're but a mortal now. You'll
          get yourself killed!

                         FANDRAL
          Or one of us, trying to protect
          you.



                         SIF
          The best thing you can do is get
          the mortals to safety and leave the
          battle to us.
          Thor looks at the townsfolk around them, all oblivious to the
          oncoming threat.

                         THOR

                         (TO SIF)
          You're right.
          Sif looks surprised. Thor turns to Jane, Selvig, and Darcy.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          Help me clear the streets. I'll
          let none of these people die this
          day.
          Thor, Jane, Selvig, and Darcy start to herd the crowd of
          Townsfolk off the streets, as the Warriors Three and Sif head

          Strides down the street, a red, fiery energy glowing from

          Volstagg stands limbering up.

                         FANDRAL

                         (TO VOLSTAGG)
          Come on!


          Volstagg takes off running at full speed.
          As he catches up to his comrades, Hogun and Fandral grab him
          on either side, and with all their Asgardian might, hurl the
          voluminous warrior into the air at the black metal behemoth.

                         VOLSTAGG
          For Asgaaaaard!!!


          The Destroyer is unable to react quickly enough, as Volstagg
          SMASHES into the creature. It looks like it might actually
          work for a moment, but the Destroyer stays on its feet. It
          lifts Volstagg into the by the scruff of his neck. He shrugs
          apologetically.
          The Destroyer savagely HURLS him at Hogun and Fandral,
          smashing into them, when --

                         SIF
          Leaps off a nearby rooftop with her two-headed spear and
          plunges it deep into the back of the creature.
          The creature stands there motionless, the fire dimming in its
          faceplate, Sif standing atop its back. The Asgardians have a
          brief moment of hope.
          But the creature stirs with life, its fire igniting once
          again. Sif looks on with growing trepidation.
          Slowly, unnaturally, the Destroyer spins its torso around 
          degrees to face its attackers.
          The Destroyer unleashes a blast at Sif. She barely dives off
          of the behemoth in time, dodging the blast. The Destroyer
          rises again to its full height, pulling free from Sif's
          staff, the weapon slipping through the slats of its armor.
          Sif and the Warriors Three try to regroup, when the Destroyer
          unleashes another blast, sending Sif and her comrades flying
          in all directions. Hogun's POUCH OF HEALING STONES breaks
          free, landing in the middle of the street.

           EXT. SMITH MOTORS - DAY 

          Thor sees his friends lying injured on the ground, but has no
          time to act, as the Destroyer fires in his direction.
          A storefront near Smith Motor EXPLODES, knocking Thor, Jane,
          and Selvig off their feet. Thor helps Jane to her feet, when
          they notice Selvig lying on his back amidst the debris,
          impaled by a twisted piece of iron.

                         JANE
          Erik!
          She and Thor hurry to his side. He's losing blood, going
          into shock.

                         SELVIG

                         (TO JANE)
          Go! Leave me!


          Jane takes his hand as Thor spots Hogun's pouch of healing
          stones lying in the middle of the street. He makes a break
          for it, dodging through the flaming wreckage, then grabs the
          pouch and races back.
          He opens the pouch to find the fragile stones crushed and
          useless. He pours the contents out in his hand.

                         THOR
          Come on... give me one!
          Amidst the useless powder, he finally finds one stone still
          intact. Thor tosses the pouch aside, holds the stone over
          the end of the iron rod.

                         JANE
          What are you doing? What is that?
          As the stone begins to glow, Thor crushes it.
          Jane looks on, amazed, as the glowing powder falls upon the
          piece of iron, dissolving it, heading downwards, until it
          reaches Selvig's wound. The powder heals his wound
          completely.
          Thor looks down the street, sees his wounded friends still
          lying there, as Selvig sits up in utter astonishment. He
          reaches through the hole in his shirt to touch his healed
          flesh.

                         SELVIG
          (to Jane, re: Thor)
          I'm really starting to like him.
          Jane turns to Thor to find he's gone.

           EXT. DOWN THE STREET 

          Thor reaches Sif, who lies dazed, battered, and bloodied on
          the ground. He pulls her behind a burning vehicle.

                         THOR
          Go, while you can!

                         SIF
          But the others...

                         THOR
          You can't help them now. Your job
          is to survive.
          She struggles to sit up.



                         SIF
          No! I will die a warrior's death.
          Stories will be told of this day--
          He gently takes her shield from her.

                         THOR
          Live and tell those stories
          yourself.
          At last, she nods. Thor spots Volstagg lying unconscious,
          with Hogun and Fandral lying nearby. Thor makes his way
          towards them.
          Volstagg is barely breathing. Thor tries to pull him to
          safety, but it's no use. He won't budge. He rouses Hogun
          and Fandral.

          THOR (CONT'D)

                         (RE: VOLSTAGG)
          Get him out of here!

                         FANDRAL
          No. We can still fight!

                         THOR
          But not win. Move Volstagg, or
          he'll die!
          Thor looks at them, grins.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          Don't worry, my friends. I have a
          plan.
          The two Warriors reluctantly grab their fallen friend and
          drag him away from the battlefield.
          After they go, Thor turns to back to the Destroyer, then
          tosses Sif's shield aside.
          He strides down the street towards the behemoth, completely
          defenseless.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          Brother... for whatever I have done
          to wrong you, whatever I have done
          to lead you to do this, I am sorry.
          But these people have done nothing
          to you. They are innocents.
          He continues towards the Destroyer.

 B.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          Take my life, and know I will never
          return to Asgard.


          Thor reaches the Destroyer, extends his arms.
          The Destroyer hesitates, sizing up the defenseless Thor, then
          swats him with its enormous arm. We hear the sickening CRACK
          of breaking bones as Thor goes flying.
          Thor lands in a crumpled, broken heap in front of Smith
          Motors, before Jane, Selvig, and Darcy.
          The wounded Asgardians watch helplessly from down the street,
          a look of horror on their faces. Jane tries to rush out to
          Thor's aid, but Selvig holds her back.

                         SELVIG
          Jane, no!
          He pulls her into Smith Motors. A RAVEN flies overhead,
          watching the scene --

           INT. ODIN'S CHAMBERS - SAME TIME 

          Odin lies in the Odinsleep.
          A single tear rolls down the Allfather's cheek.

  .

           EXT. SMITH MOTORS - DAY 

          Thor's eyes close, his last breath leaving his lips. The
          Destroyer stands over Thor's body, lowers its head towards
          him. It opens its faceplate, locks it in place, readying to
          unleash its fiery blast.

           EXT. SHIELD DESERT BASE 

          Inside the crater, the RUNES of the side of Mjolnir reappear,
          burning bright. Electricity starts to CRACKLE on the
          hammer's surface. SCIENTISTS beside it take notice as it
          vibrates, and a RUMBLE comes from overhead. They look up.
          Clouds form in the sky above.
          Just then, with a CRACK and flash of lightning, Mjolnir flies
          straight up into the air like a rocket.

           EXT. MAIN STREET 

          The Destroyer unleashes its blast at Thor's body, when --

          KRAKAKABOOM!
          A blinding BOLT OF LIGHTNING strikes down from above,
          colliding with the Destroyer's blast. The explosion is
          massive. The Destroyer is hurled backwards, a cloud of dust
          enveloping the street. As the smoke clears we see --

                         JANE
          Oh. My. God.

          THE MIGHTY THOR
          Clad in his full battle armor, holding Mjolnir in his hand --
          the God of Thunder once more. Thor kneels, brings Mjolnir
          down onto the ground.

          KRAKABOOM!
          Lightning strikes the Destroyer. It convulses. Thor swings
          Mjolnir around, takes off straight up into the air, as the
          Destroyer gets back on its feet and looks up at the Thunder
          God. Storm clouds gather around Thor as he summons gale
          force winds.
          Debris from the battle begins to rise up into the sky. The
          Destroyer stays there, kept grounded by its massive weight.

 .
          It lifts its head up at the Thunder God, opens its faceplate,
          locks it in place, unleashes its blast. Thor dives downwards
          straight at it, with Mjolnir before him.
          Mjolnir collides with the Destroyer's fiery energy blast,
          overpowering it, pushing it back, forcing it downwards at the
          Destroyer.
          Thor jams his hammer deep into the Destroyer's faceplate.
          The fiery energy within the creature builds up and EXPLODES
          within him, firing out of all his openings.
          Thor smashes the Destroyer to the ground in a tremendous
          heap, the fiery energy within it extinguished forever.
          Thor pulls Mjolnir from its faceplate, walks away from its
          lifeless carcass. As he does, the other objects and debris
          pulled into the air by the gale winds drop down from the
          skies, around the Destroyer, burying it.
          Jane and Thor's comrades, now roused, stand to join him.
          A battered Coulson approaches with several SHIELD AGENTS.

                         COULSON
          Donald... I don't think you've been
          completely honest with me.

           EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) - DAY 

          Thor, Jane, Darcy, Selvig and the other Asgardians stand in
          the desert with Thor, Coulson, and several SHIELD AGENTS.
          Darcy turns to Volstagg.

                         DARCY
          So, how can you speak our language?

                         VOLSTAGG
          Your language? Ha! Silly girl,
          you're speaking ours.
          Thor calls up to the sky.

                         THOR
          Heimdall! Open the Bifrost!

           EXT. RAINBOW BRIDGE - DAY 

          Heimdall stands frozen.

  .

           EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) - DAY 

          Thor looks to the others with concern.

                         THOR
          He would open it if he could. I
          fear the worst.

                         VOLSTAGG
          Then we're trapped here forever.

                         FANDRAL
          Then I suppose we'd best start
          settling into our new lives.
          He looks to Darcy, turns on the charm.

          FANDRAL (CONT'D)
          Are all earth maidens as fair as
          you?
          Darcy enjoys the attention.

                         DARCY
          No.
          Thor shouts back up to the sky.

                         THOR
          Heimdall!

           EXT. RAINBOW BRIDGE - DAY 

          From inside the ice, Heimdall hears Thor calling to him.
          Knowing that the fate of Asgard depends on him, he musters
          all his strength. The ice around him begins to CRACK. With
          a tremendous effort, Heimdall SHATTERS free from the ice.
          Weakened, near death, he drags himself inside the
          Observatory.

           EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) - DAY 

          The Asgardians begin to lose hope. Volstagg eyes a SHIELD
          Agent's machine gun.

                         VOLSTAGG
          Primitive. Good enough for hunting
          small game, I suppose.
          Suddenly, the Bifrost EXPLODES down from the sky. Thor
          grins. The mortals look on, amazed. Fandral turns to Darcy.



                         FANDRAL
          Sorry, my love. These things
          happen.

 .
          He joins the other Asgardians at their side. Thor turns to
          Coulson.

                         THOR
          Know this, son of Coul. You and I,
          we fight for the same cause -- the
          protection of this world. From
          this day forward, count me as your
          ally.

                         (THEN)
          If you return the items you have
          stolen from Jane Foster.

                         COULSON
          Not stolen. Borrowed.
          Jane shoots him a look. Coulson quickly continues.

          COULSON (CONT'D)
          You'll get your equipment back.
          You're going to need it to continue
          your research... which, after
          today's events, SHIELD would like
          to fully sponsor. If that's all
          right with you.
          Thor takes Jane's hand, kisses it tenderly. She looks at
          him, her eyes filled with the fear that she may never see him
          again.

                         THOR
          Whatever fate lies before me, you
          are part of it.
          He takes her in his arms, kisses her passionately. Thor and
          the Asgardians leap into the Bifrost.

           INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY - DAY 

          The Asgardians emerge from the Bifrost to find Heimdall
          slumped over his controls.

                         THOR
          (to the others)
          Get him to the healing room! Leave
          my brother to me.

 .
          Thor bolts out the door.

           INT. ODIN'S CHAMBERS - DAY 

          Odin lies in the Odinsleep, Frigga at his bedside. She hears
          the SHOUTS of Guards outside, the sound of a battle. Frigga
          grabs a sword.
          A Frost Giant bursts in. She swings the sword around hard,
          cleaving into his shoulder. He swats her aside angrily.
          Laufey and the Brute Frost Giant enter.
          Laufey looks at Odin lying helpless on the bed.

           EXT. RAINBOW BRIDGE - DAY 

          Thor rides the winds over the Bridge, speeding towards the
          palace.

           INT. ODIN'S CHAMBERS - DAY 

          The Jotun king stands over the unconscious Odin, relishing
          the moment.
          He forms an ICE BLADE.

           EXT. ODIN'S PALACE - DAY 

          Thor races through the entrance to the palace.

           INT. ODIN'S CHAMBERS - DAY 

          Laufey stands before the sleeping Odin.

                         LAUFEY
          It's said you can still see and
          hear what transpires around you,
          even in this state. I hope it's
          true, so that you may know your
          death came by the hand of Laufey.
          He raises his blade above Odin's body, when --

          A BLAST OF ENERGY
          Hits him from behind. As the Jotun king falls to the ground,
          we see it is not Thor standing behind him, but Loki, holding
          Gungnir.

                         LOKI
          And your death came by the son of
          Odin.


          Laufey dies as the other two shocked Frost Giants move for
          Loki. He fires Gungnir at one, blasting him against a wall,
          taking him out.

 .
          The Brute is nearly upon him, when the Jotun stops suddenly,
          his eyes going wide. The Brute falls to the ground,

                         REVEALING --

                         FRIGGA
          Standing behind him -- the sword stuck in his back. She
          looks to Loki, takes him in her arms.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          I swear to you, mother, they will
          pay for what they've done today. I
          will end the Jotun threat, now and
          forever!
          He looks to Odin.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          And I will make you proud.
          Loki savors the moment, but it's short-lived, as Thor bursts
          in. He's thrown by the scene before him -- Odin safe, Laufey
          and two Jotuns dead, Frigga regarding Loki with pride and
          respect. Stunned and delighted to see Thor, Frigga beams.

                         FRIGGA
          Thor!
          She moves to Thor and hugs him, but Thor's eyes remain fixed
          on his brother. Loki looks at Mjolnir in his brother's hand.

                         LOKI
          Found its way back to you, did it?

                         THOR
          No thanks to you.
          Frigga picks up on the tension building between her sons.

                         FRIGGA
          What?

                         THOR
          Why don't you tell her? How you
          sent the Destroyer to kill our
          friends? To kill me?
          Frigga looks to Loki, alarmed and confused.

                         LOKI
          It must have been enforcing
          Father's last command.

                         THOR
          You're a talented liar, brother.
          Always have been.

                         LOKI

                         (SMILES)
          It's good to have you back.

                         (DEAD SERIOUS)
          Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to
          destroy Jotunheim.
          Loki suddenly raises Gungnir, FIRES it point-blank at Thor.
          Thor goes flying backwards, SMASHING through the chamber
          walls, into...

           INT. ODIN'S PALACE - CORRIDOR 

          Thor flies from the blast through ANOTHER wall on the
          opposite side of the corridor, to...

           EXT. PALACE GROUNDS - DAY 

          Thor plummets from the palace and CRASHES into the reflecting
          pools below.

           EXT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY - DAY 

          Loki speeds on horseback down the Rainbow Bridge, then
          quickly dismounts and enters the Observatory.

           INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY - DAY 

          Loki operates the Observatory's controls. The massive turret
          spins, points.

           EXT. PALACE GROUNDS - DAY 

          Thor awakens to the sound of the Bifrost. He stands, sees
          the Observatory firing the Bifrost energy into space. He
          looks to where the Bifrost is aimed.

                         THOR
          Jotunheim...

           EXT. RAINBOW BRIDGE - DAY 

          Thor soars on the winds above the Rainbow Bridge, the Bifrost
          energy roaring through Bridge, feeding into the Observatory.
          He lands before the Observatory's huge doorway.

           INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY 

          Thor enters, shields his eyes from the brilliant light of the
          Bifrost energy blasting towards Jotunheim.


          He looks over to the controls, sees that they're frozen in an
          enormous block of ice. Loki stands atop it.

                         LOKI
          All these years, and no one's ever
          dared to use it as a weapon.
          Thor hurries to the ice, raises his hammer to SMASH through
          it to get to the controls frozen within. Before he can, Loki
          fires Gungnir. The blast hits the ice in front of Thor,
          blasting him back across the floor. Loki steps down from the
          ice as Thor staggers to his feet.

 .

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          You can't stop it. The Bifrost
          will build until it rips Jotunheim
          apart.

                         THOR
          Why have you done this?

                         LOKI
          To do what Father never could. To
          destroy their kind forever. When
          he awakens, he'll see the wisdom of
          what I've done.

                         THOR
          He won't! You can't kill an entire
          race!

                         LOKI
          What is this newfound love for the
          Frost Giants? You, who would have
          killed them all with your bare
          hands.

                         THOR
          I've changed.

                         LOKI
          So have I.
          Loki hits Thor across the face with Gungnir.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          Fight me.
          He swings Gungnir at Thor again. Thor catches it in his
          hand, rears back his hammer as if ready to return the blow,
          but instead takes to the air and flies past Loki, back
          towards the frozen controls.
          Loki spins around, aims Gungnir, and fires a blast which
          immobilizes Thor in the air. He hangs there, suspended.

                         THOR
          Is the throne really worth what
          you've done? What you would
          become?

                         LOKI
          I never wanted the throne. I only
          wanted to be your equal. Now fight
          me!

 .
          With a gesture of Gungnir, he flings Thor to the ground.
          Thor rises to his feet, turns to Loki.

                         THOR
          I will not fight you, brother.

                         LOKI
          I am not your brother. I never
          was.

                         THOR
          Loki, this is madness...
          Loki grins.

                         LOKI
          Is it?
          He FIRES Gungnir at Thor. Thor dodges the blast, rolls to
          his feet.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          What happened to you on earth that
          turned you so soft? Don't tell me
          it was a woman.
          Thor doesn't answer. Loki laughs, realizing he's right.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          It was. Perhaps when we're
          finished here I'll pay her a little
          visit myself.
          That did it. Loki and Thor rush at each other. They and
          their weapons collide.
          The two battle -- Loki unleashing years of pent-up rage and
          jealousy, Thor having no choice but to defend himself.

           EXT. JOTUNHEIM - DAY 

          It's mayhem. The growing Bifrost TEARS through the ice of
          the planet like a destructive wave, breaking it apart.
          JOTUNS go running in terror, others fall through the breaking
          ice.

           EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) 

           Jane, Selvig, Darcy, and Coulson look up with concern at the
           hole in the sky, where excess Bifrost energy builds up around
          it.

                          SELVIG
          Jane?



                         JANE
          Something's wrong.

  .

           INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY 

          Thor and Loki battle savagely. Loki fires Gungnir, sending
          Thor sliding across the floor and knocking Mjolnir from his
          hand.
          The hammer flies into the Bifrost towards Jotunheim.
          Thor raises his hand towards his hammer, tries to summon it
          back to him, to keep it in this Realm, but the Bifrost is too
          powerful.
          Mjolnir disappears into the maelstrom as Thor himself slides
          towards the Bifrost.

                         LOKI
          If you care so much for the Jotuns,
          then die with them.
          The Bifrost stretches every cell of Thor's body, trying to
          drag him away. He's nearly swallowed by the vortex, when he
          concentrates, mustering his will. He reaches out his hand
          towards the Bifrost.
          MJOLNIR flies back through the maelstrom, into Thor's hand.
          The hammer pulls him free. Loki tries to fire off another
          blast at him, but Thor takes to the air, speeds towards his
          brother.

           EXT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY 

          Thor and Loki come CRASHING through the Observatory dome and
          land hard, rolling across the Rainbow Bridge. As Thor gets
          to his feet, he sees Loki dangling off the Bridge's edge.

                         LOKI
          Thor! Help me!
          Thor steps over to the side of the Bridge, sees Loki looking
          up at him desperately.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          Please...
          Loki's fingers start to slip. Thor reaches down to grab his
          brother's wrist, but his hand passes through Loki's. Just
          then, the REAL LOKI materializes behind him. Thor whirls
          around as Loki STABS him in the chest with Gungnir.
          Loki lifts Thor into the air, impaled on the spear, and hurls
          him across the bridge.

 .
          Thor, bleeding, rises to his knees. Loki strides up behind
          him to finish him off, when Thor swing his hammer around.
          It passes through him. Instantly, another Loki appears next
          to him, Thor swings his hammer, but that too is an illusion.
          Loki after Loki appears, Thor futilely swinging at each one,
          never making contact. Thor falls back to his knees. The
          Lokis grin as their raises their spears, encircling him.

                         LOKIS
          I was always more clever than you.

                         THOR
          Yet still not clever enough.
          With that, Thor raises his hammer, rising into the air,
          summoning lightning. A massive bolt strikes Mjolnir, then
          channels outwards, splitting up, striking each one of the
          Lokis.
          All of them dissipate into nothingness, save one -- the real
          Loki -- who's sent flying back across the Bridge, Gungnir
          knocked from his grasp.
          Thor steps over to his fallen brother, lying dazed on his
          back. Loki winces, prepares for the worst, when Thor steps
          away.
          Loki opens his eyes, tries to stand, but can't. He looks
          confused, then sees what the problem is -- Mjolnir rests atop
          his chest. Struggle as he may, Loki can't lift it off. He's
          pinned to the ground.
          Thor looks about him desperately -- at the Bifrost firing
          towards Jotunheim, gaining in strength, at the surge of
          energy moving through the Bridge. He's at a loss of what to
          do.
          Loki watches him smugly.

                         LOKI
          Look at you, the Mighty Thor.
          With all your strength, what good
          does it do you now?
          Thor knows Loki's right. He's powerless to stop what's
          happening. He looks down at the Bridge beneath his feet,
          VIBRATING from the force and speed of the Bifrost energy
          feeding into the Observatory. Then he gets an idea.
          He realizes what he must do -- and what he must sacrifice.
          Thor extends his hand towards Loki, summoning Mjolnir. The
          hammer goes flying to his grasp. Loki looks confused.


          Thor raises Mjolnir in the air. Clouds form above him,
          thunder RUMBLING. Lightning arcs off of his hammer, as he
          channels the power of the storm into it, then --
          He strikes Mjolnir down upon the Rainbow Bridge. The blow is
          massive, causing a rumbling along the whole bridge, shaking
          the Observatory itself like an earthquake. A crack appears
          where the blow struck. Loki rises to his feet.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          Stop! What are you doing?!
          Thor lifts the hammer again, brings it down harder. BOOM!
          The crack grows bigger. The Bifrost energy starts to stream
          out from it. Loki thinks fast.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          If you destroy the Bridge, you'll
          never see her again!
          Loki grabs Gungnir, runs towards him, ready to pierce Thor
          through the back.

                         THOR
          Forgive me.
          Summoning every bit of strength he has left, Thor raises
          Mjolnir one last time, drawing lightning to it from all
          sides, and brings it down with a final, terrible blow --
          KRAKABOOM! The Bifrost SHATTERS, rainbow energy EXPLODING
          out of it.
          Both Loki and Thor are hurled into the air by the force of
          the blast. A wave of destruction moves forward along the
          Bridge towards the Observatory, breaking it apart as it goes.
          The Observatory RIPS ITSELF APART.
          As Loki and Thor fall together, Thor grabs hold of one end of
          Gungnir, while Loki still clutches the other. They both fall
          towards the MASSIVE WAVE of Bifrost energy which spews out
          from the broken Bridge.
          They're an instant from being blasted by the destructive
          force of the energy, carried away by the current, pulverized
          by the debris, when --

          A POWERFUL HAND
          Catches Thor's leg. Thor dangles there, holding onto Gungnir
          as Loki hangs onto the other end. Loki looks up, shocked to

                         SEE --



                         ODIN ALLFATHER
          Standing on the edge of the broken Bridge, awakened from the
          Odinsleep, restored to his full strength.
          Loki searches his father's face, looking for some kind of
          approval, some kind of redemption, but all he sees is
          disappointment and regret.
          Loki lets go.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          No!
          But it's too late. Odin and Thor can only watch as Loki
          falls into the rushing torrent of Bifrost energy. It carries
          him away, along with the debris of the Bridge and the
          Observatory, disappearing out of sight.
          Odin pulls Thor up onto the Bridge. Drained, Thor falls back
          into his father's arms.

                         ODIN
          It is over.

           BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) - DAY 
          The Bifrost energy explodes in the sky like fireworks firing
          in all directions.
          Jane, Selvig, Darcy, and Coulson stand watching in amazement.
          Jane looks back up at the sky, distraught. She knows the
          significance of what's just happened.

                         JANE
          It's gone.

           INT. ODIN'S PALACE - BANQUET HALL - NIGHT 

          A FEAST is in progress as Thor, Sif, and the Warriors Three
          sit amongst the gathered Asgardians. Hogun sits between
          Fandral and Volstagg, who is in the middle of recounting
          their battle with the Destroyer.

                         VOLSTAGG
          ...and then, with a mighty bellow,
          I flew at the great metal beast and
          laid it low...



                         FANDRAL
          Is that another way of saying you
          fell on your huge a--

                         VOLSTAGG
          As a matter of fact, falling down
          was a tactic. Lulling the
          Destroyer into a false sense of
          security!

                         FANDRAL
          Well, I was the one who had to drag
          your enormous carcass off the
          battlefield. That makes me the
          real hero. Doesn't it, Hogun?
          Hogun points to Volstagg.

                         HOGUN
          Big stomach.
          (points to Fandral)
          Big mouth.
          The other gathered Asgardians laugh. Volstagg and Fandral
          look to Hogun. The grim warrior gives just a trace of a
          smile.

                         FANDRAL
          Well, how about that? A smile!
          I'd say that calls for another
          drink!
          They laugh and raise another round.
          Frigga sits nearby, lost in thought, her face betraying the
          sadness she struggles to conceal. Sif notices, approaches
          Frigga, bows her head.

                         SIF
          My Queen. I am so sorry for your
          loss.
          Frigga takes Sif's hand appreciatively.

                         FRIGGA
          Thank you, Sif.
          She looks to Thor, who's unable to enjoy the merriment around
          him.

          FRIGGA (CONT'D)
          How is he?



                         SIF
          He mourns for his brother. And he
          misses her. The mortal.
          Frigga sees the trace of regret in Sif's face as she looks at
          Thor with new feelings. He rises and leaves the hall.

                         FRIGGA
          He will need his friends now more
          than ever.

                         SIF
          I will always be at his side.
          Frigga understands, puts her arm around Sif gratefully.

           EXT. PALACE BALCONY - NIGHT 

          Thor stands alone on the balcony, lost in thought. Odin
          walks up behind him.

                         ODIN
          You'll be a wise King.

                         THOR
          There will never be a wiser king
          than you. Or a better father.

                         (THEN)
          I have much to learn. I know that
          now. But some day, perhaps, I will
          make you proud.

                         ODIN
          You've already made me proud.
          Odin leaves, Thor consoled by his words.

           EXT. RAINBOW BRIDGE - NIGHT 

          Out of the broken, jagged Rainbow Bridge flows the Bifrost
          energy, drifting off into space.
          Thor walks out to its edge, where Heimdall stands watch.
          Thor stares out at the stellar void.



                         THOR
          Can you see her?
          Heimdall turns, gazes out towards Earth.

                         HEIMDALL
          Yes.

                         THOR
          How is she?

           EXT. SMITH MOTORS - LAB - NIGHT 

          Through the window into Jane's lab, we see an enlarged
          ILLUSTRATION from her notebook pinned to a board. As we pull
          away, we see a computer terminal displaying a program clearly
          inspired by the illustration. We pull further back to see
          that the lab has been transformed into a well-funded research
          facility, abuzz with activity.
          SHIELD SCIENTISTS and AGENTS work with impressive, state-of-
          the-art equipment.
          Selvig orchestrates the process, giving instructions to the
          SCIENTISTS. We continue to track right outside the glass
          windows and rise up to find Jane sitting at the front of the
          roof, working at a small, improvised workstation, notebook at
          hand, as always. She sets up an impressive, HIGH-TECH DEVICE
          before her, which bears the "STARK INDUSTRIES" logo.
          From behind, Darcy approaches, hands her a flash drive.

                         DARCY
          Here you go.

                         JANE
          Thanks.
          Jane inserts the flash drive into the device.

                         DARCY
          He would have come back if he
          could.

                         JANE
          I know. But if he can't get here
          on his own...
          Jane hits a switch on the device. Suddenly, a -D
          HOLOGRAPHIC PROJECTION bursts to life over the device,
          bathing the two women in its glow. We recognize what it is --
          YGGDRASIL, in all its beauty.

                         

                         

                         

                         
"

           JANE (CONT'D)
           ...maybe we can help him find his
           way back.

           OMITTED COMBINED WITH SCENE  ABOVE 

                          FADE OUT:

                          THE END

 "And there came a day, a day unlike any other, when Earth's
          mightiest heroes and heroines found themselves united against a
          common threat. On that day, the Avengers were born--to fight the
          foes no single superhero could withstand! Through the years,
          their roster has prospered, changing many times, but their glory
          has never been denied! Heed the call, then--for now, the Avengers
          Assemble!"

          BURNING BLUE FLAMES. A smoky cube shape emerges - THE TESSERACT.
          Filling the screen with BLACKNESS.

          EXT. THRONE ROOM, SPACE Â­ NIGHT

          Kneeling behind a THRONE, a CLOTHED, ARMORED FIGURE known as THE
          OTHER, bows.

           THE OTHER (V.O.)
           The Tesseract has awakened. It is on a
           little world. A human world. They would
           wield its power,...

                          CUT TO:
          THE OTHER faces a HORNED SHAPED SHADOW. LOKI. Loki is handed the
          CHITAURI SCEPTER, a long golden handle, fitted with a blue gem
          encircled with silver blades.

           THE OTHER (V.O.)
           But our ally knows its workings as they
           never will. He is ready to lead. And
           our force, our Chitauri, will follow.

          HIGH WIDE ON: TENS OF THOUSANDS of CHITAURI stand ready in a
          seething mass of neat rows and columns....the ground simply

          QUAKES.

           THE OTHER (V.O.)
           The world will be his. The universe
           yours. And the humans, what can they do
           but burn?

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. S.H.I.E.L.D. PROJECT P.E.G.A.S.U.S FACILITY Â­ NIGHT

          Out in the NEW MEXICO desert, a remote research facility is in a
          state of panic. It's an evacuation. A SWOOPING helicopter flies
          in.

          CHAOS. Men in suits run around like in the typical `we have to
          leave' fashion. Soldiers on foot jump onto Humvees, accelerating
          the hell out of there. A VOICE bellows from hidden loudspeakers.

          EXT. HELICOPTER PAD Â­ CONTINUOUS

          Standing a few yards from the landing pad, A Fed in a suit with
          badass shades, peers at the helicopter as it lands. This is

          SHIELD AGENT PHIL COULSON.

          Walking out of the helicopter is SHIELD AGENT MARIA HILL, SEXY,
          FIERCE AND DETERMINED. Following her, SHIELD DIRECTOR NICK FURY
          climbs out. Hill and Fury approach Agent Coulson.

                          NICK FURY
           How bad is it?

                       AGENT PHIL COULSON
           That's the problem, sir. We don't know.

          INT. FACILITY FLOOR Â­ NIGHT

          Agent Coulson leads Hill and Fury through the radiation section
          of the facility. Hundreds of technicians and other staff run
          around, taking only the essentials.

                       AGENT PHIL COULSON
           Dr. Selvig read an energy surge from
           the Tesseract four hours ago.

                          NICK FURY
           NASA didn't authorize Selvig to test
           phase.

                        AGENT PHIL COULSON
           He wasn't testing it, he wasn't even in
           the room. Spontaneous advancement.

                        AGENT MARIA HILL
           It just turned itself on?

                          NICK FURY
           What are the energy levels now?

                        AGENT PHIL COULSON
           Climbing. When Selvig couldn't shut it
           down, we ordered the evac.

                          NICK FURY
           How long to get everyone out?

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           Campus should be clear in the next half
           hour.

                          NICK FURY
           Do better.

          CONTINUOUSLY HEADING DOWN TO RADIATION FACILITY FLOOR

                         AGENT MARIA HILL
           Sir, evacuation may be futile.

                          NICK FURY
           We should tell them to go back to
           sleep?

                         AGENT MARIA HILL
           If we can't control the Tesseract's
           energy, there may not be a minimum safe
           distance.

                          NICK FURY
           I need you to make sure that PHASE 2
           prototypes are shipped out.

                          AGENT MARIA HILL
           Sir, is that really a priority right
           now?

                          NICK FURY
           Until such time as the world ends, we
           will act as though it intends to spin
           on. Clear out the tech below. Every
           piece of PHASE 2 on a truck and gone.

                          AGENT MARIA HILL
           Yes, sir.
           (to standing agents)
           With me.

          INT. NASA SPACE RADIATION FACILITY, VACUUM CHAMBER Â­ CONTINUOUS

          Fury enters the lab facility where the Tesseract is being held
          by a COMPACT MUON SOLENOID COIL CHAMBER.

                          NICK FURY
           Talk to me, doctor.
          DR. ERIK SELVIG emerges from behind the CMS machine, concerned.
          The Tesseract is glowing unusually brighter and flare rings
          shoot out at random.

                          SELVIG
           Director.

                          NICK FURY
           Is there anything we know for certain?

                          SELVIG
           Tesseract is misbehaving.

                          NICK FURY
           Is that supposed to be funny?

                          SELVIG
           No, it's not funny at all. The
           Tesseract is not only active,
           she's...misbehaving.

                          NICK FURY
           How soon until you pull the plug?

                          SELVIG
           She's an energy source. If we turn off
           the power, she turns it back on. If she
           reaches peak level...

                          NICK FURY
           We've prepared for this, doctor.
           Harnessing energy from space.

                          SELVIG
           We don't have the harness. Our
           calculations are far from complete. Now
           she's throwing off interference,
           radiation. Nothing harmful, low levels
           of gamma radiation.

                          NICK FURY
           That can be harmful. Where's Barton?

                          SELVIG
           The Hawk? Up in his nest, as usual.
          We see CLINT BARTON, dressed in black tactical gear, is up on
          the railings watching them below, Fury calls Barton on his
          earpiece.

                          NICK FURY
           Agent Barton, report.
          BARTON rappels down from the catwalk. Walks up to Fury. They
          both walk around the facility in a discreet manner.

                          NICK FURY
           I gave you this detail so you could
           keep a close eye on things.

                          CLINT BARTON
           Well, I see better from a distance.

                          NICK FURY
           Are you seeing anything that might set
           this thing off?

                          NASA SCIENTIST

                          (TO SELVIG)
           Doctor, it's spiking again.

                          CLINT BARTON
           No one's come or gone. It's oven is
           clean. No contacts, no I.M.'s. If there
           was any tampering, sir, it wasn't at
           this end.

                          NICK FURY
           At this end?

                          CLINT BARTON
           Yeah, the cube is a doorway to the
           other end of space, right? The doors
           open from both sides.
          DR. SELVIG clacks away at the keyboard and sees on the
          monitoring his worst nightmares. Suddenly- the Tesseract
          THUNDERS and SHAKES the entire facility. Big enough where both
          Agents Hill and Coulson can feel and they're at different ends
          of the facility.
          The flaring rings and glow of the cube spout out brighter and
          louder, like a boiling pot of water. The Tesseract's energy
          builds up into a BEAM much like the Bifrost Bridge, which HITS
          at the end of a platform that is wired to the CMS device. The
          great maelstrom beam FIRES the TESSERACT energy. The beam then
          forms a VORTEX, which then opens up a PORTAL.
          A BLACK HOLE IS CREATED. From the portal, the blackness of
          SPACE, beautiful and mysterious, strewn with a billion stars
          appears and a GUST of BLUE ENERGY CLOUDS fill the room, blinding
          everyone.
          The Tesseract's energy forms into a cloud that reaches to the
          top the facility's vacuum chamber ceiling. It's abnormally
          quiet. Then... HEAVY BREATHING is heard from the platform.
          SHIELD GUARDS slowly approach, weapons in hands. A figure is
          kneeling on the platform, smoke coming off it. It's LOKI.
          Smiling in his mischievous manner, he raises his head. The smile
          dies down. He looks deep into the eyes of Fury, Barton and
          Selvig. He stands up, holing the scepter.

                          NICK FURY
           Sir, please put down the spear!
          Loki looks at his spear then suddenly points it at where Fury
          and Barton are standing and SHOOTS OUT A BLUE EXPLODING LIGHT
          TOWARDS THEM. BARTON TACKLES Fury and they both barely miss
          Loki's fired shot.
          ALL HELL BREAKS. Machine gun fire is shot at Loki, but the
          bullets bounce off him like a boss. Loki jumps high from the
          platform and ATTACKS those firing at him.
          In the blink of an eye, Loki takes down several guards with his
          KNIVES and ENERGY BLASTS from the scepter. He stops and waits to
          see who will attack him next. Honestly, the whole lab has almost
          gone to shit.
          Barton tries to stand up. Loki quickly walks towards him. Barton
          raises his gun, but Loki grabs Barton's hand.

                          LOKI
           You have heart.
          Loki points the head of his spear at Barton's head. Barton's
          eyes suddenly glow BLACK. The ability to control Barton's mind
          is now in Loki's hand. Barton puts his piece away and stands
          straight.
          As Loki is busy using his abilities to control the minds of
          several S.H.I.E.L.D. personnel, Fury takes the Tesseract,
          placing it back into its case and tries to leave the lab.Then...

                          LOKI
           Please don't. I still need that.

                          NICK FURY

                          (TURNING)
           This doesn't have to get any messier.

                          LOKI
           Of course it does. I've come too far
           for anything else. I am Loki of Asgard,
           and I am burdened with glorious
           purpose.

                          SELVIG
           Loki? Brother of Thor?

                          NICK FURY
           We have no quarrel with your people.

                          LOKI
           An ant has no quarrel with a boot.

                          NICK FURY
           You planning to step on us?

                          LOKI
           I come with glad tidings, of a world
           made free.

                          NICK FURY
           Free from what?

                          LOKI
           Freedom. Freedom is life's great lie.
           Once you accept that, in your heart...
          Like a gunslinger, Loki turns to face Selvig who's
          standingbehind him and places his spear against Selvig's heart.
          Selvig's eyes glow BLACK.

                          LOKI
           You will know peace.

                          NICK FURY
           Yeah, you say peace, I kind of think
           you mean the other thing.
          From the vacuum chamber ceiling, Tesseract's energy cloud
          RAPIDLY builds into what may be an implosion.

                          CLINT BARTON
           Sir, Director Fury is stalling. This
           place is about to blow. Drop a hundred
           feet of rock on us. He means to bury
           us.

                          NICK FURY
           Like The Pharaohs of Odin.

                          SELVIG
           He's right. The portal is collapsing in
           on itself. You got maybe two minutes
           before this goes critical.

                          LOKI
           Well, then...
          Loki, looking at Barton, who doesn't even hesitate, SHOOTS FURY
          WHO FALLS TO THE GROUND. Barton grabs the case containing the
          Tesseract and leaves the lab with Loki, Selvig and the other
          S.H.I.E.L.D personnel Loki is controlling.

          INT. P.E.G.A.S.U.S BUNKER, ENTRANCE OF EXITING TUNNEL Â­ NIGHT

          Loki, Barton, Selvig and the other S.H.I.E.L.D personnel are in
          the parking lot of the facility, quickly gathering certain
          weapons. Agent Hill watches in confusion, referring to Loki.

                          CLINT BARTON
           (pointing to the Loki team)
           Need these vehicles.

           AGENT MARIA HILL
           Who's that?

                          CLINT BARTON
           He didn't tell me.
          Agent Hill looks suspiciously at them as they get into the truck
          and turns to leave, as she's walking away...

                          NICK FURY
           (through the walkie talkie)
           Hill, do you copy?!
          Loki and Barton SHARPLY look at Agent Hill.

          BACK AT THE LAB
          Fury is sitting up, pulling out the bullet, breathing heavily.

                          NICK FURY
           Barton is...

          INT. P.E.G.A.S.U.S BUNKER Â­ NIGHT

          Suddenly, Hill turns to SHOOT AT BARTON, but Barton is already
          POINTING HIS GUN at her and starts SHOOTING, he moves the
          driver's seat of the truck and DRIVES OFF as Hill keeps
          shooting.

          BACK AT THE LAB
          Fury is holding his side, running.

                          NICK FURY
           He's got the Tesseract! Track it down!
          The energy is really brewing a fucking shit storm from the
          vacuum chamber ceiling.

          INT. P.E.G.A.S.U.S BUNKER/TUNNEL Â­ NIGHT

          Agent Hill SLIPS into a JEEP and follows after Barton's
          truck.Loki's trucks SCREECH across the tunnel. Several SHIELD
          trucks pull up to them. A drive-by shooting ensues.
          Loki, who stands on top of the bed of the truck, uses his
          scepter and EMITS energy blasts, flipping over SHIELD trucks.
          They get in, the cars roar out after them. Agent Hill puts
          herself at a distance.

          INT. FACILITY FLOOR Â­ NIGHT

          Fury races out of the hallway, avoiding falling pipes. The
          entire facility is now in a full earthquake.

          INT. FACILITY FLOOR, ELSEWHERE Â­ CONTINUOUS

          Agent Coulson and several SHIELD agents fall down the steps,
          dropping SILVER CASES of information. They attempt to grab them,
          but...

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           No! Leave it!
          They run out of there like a bat from hell.

          INT. P.E.G.A.S.U.S TUNNEL Â­ NIGHT

          Agent Hill's JEEP ROARS out of a side of Barton's truck and
          pulls up alongside them on the left. She goes way ahead and
          pulls her brake, swerving into a 360, facing Barton's truck and
          driving in reverse.
          Barton's ARMS reach out the open window and OPENS FIRE. Agent
          Hill figures `fuck it' and SHOOTS her windshield OPENING FIRE on
          Barton.

          EXT. VAN Â­ NIGHT

          Agent Coulson jumps into a SHIELD VAN. On his walkie:

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           You're clear, sir! You need to go!

          EXT. HELICOPTER PAD Â­ CONTINUOUS

          Fury BOLTS out of the facility and jumps into a helicopter. The
          surface of the pad gives way, PLUNGING the helicopter through
          the surface. But Fury's chopper BARELY makes it out.

          INT. P.E.G.A.S.U.S TUNNEL Â­ NIGHT

          Still in a chase and drive-by sequence, Barton's pushes the
          pedal harder, which causes Agent Hill's JEEP to WOBBLE out and
          put her back behind.

          INT. RADIATION FACILITY, VACUUM CHAMBER Â­ NIGHT

          The Tesseract's energy cloud now SHRINKS into a SMALL BALL OF
          WHITE LIGHT. Then...

          A CLOUD OF BLUE LIGHT CONSUMES THE ENTIRE FACILITY AND PARTS OF
          THE DESERT. Fury watches from below, a RAPID build-up into what
          may be an implosion. Several miles away, Agent Coulson's van
          feels a JOLT of the Tesseract's BLASTWAVE. THE ENTIRE FACILITY

          SWALLOWS INTO ITSELF-- A TERRIFYING, UNIMAGINABLE IMPLOSION.

          INT. P.E.G.A.S.U.S TUNNEL Â­ NIGHT

          The BLASTWAVE of the Tesseract causes the tunnel to cave it.
          Like an ocean wave, blinding crumbles of falling rock, fall onto
          Agent Hill's JEEP, leaving her NEARLY trapped under this blanket
          of rock.
          On the Barton's truck, they escape the tunnel and drive into the
          desert landscape. Fury's helicopter ROARS over Barton's truck.
          Loki looks up.
          From the chopper's door, it slides open and Fury stands there,
          holding a gun, SHOOTING at Barton's, giving an honoring image of

          JULES WINNFIELD.
          Loki looks at Fury and in a fit of RAGE, points his scepter
          SHOOTS OUT THE BLUE LIGHT. The chopper CATCHES on fire, GOING
          DOWN in a FIERY BALL. Fury, like the boss he is, JUMPS OUT and
          touches down onto the desert floor. The chopper BARRELS along
          the ground.
          Fury, coming back to his senses, FIRES at Loki, but they're
          toofar and too late. Loki looks back, smiling. Fury stands
          there, MIND REELING. Then...

           AGENT PHIL COULSON

                          (WALKIE TALKIE)
           Director? Director Fury, do you copy?

                          NICK FURY
           The Tesseract is with the hostile
           force. I have men down. Hill?

          INT. P.E.G.A.S.U.S TUNNEL Â­ NIGHT

          Agent Hill climbs out her JEEP, which is sandwiched in, but
          luckily, not her.

           AGENT MARIA HILL
           A lot of men still under, don't know
           how many survivors.

          EXT. DESERT Â­ NIGHT


                          NICK FURY
           Sound the general call. I want every
           living soul not working rescue looking
           for that brief case.

           AGENT MARIA HILL

                          (WALKIE TALKIE)
           Roger that.

                          NICK FURY
           Coulson, get back to base. This is a
           LEVEL SEVEN. As of right now, we are at
           war.
          A beat.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON

                          (WALKIE TALKIE)
           What do we do?
          Fury stands there. Thinking. He looks up. On his face is sign of
          hope.

                         THE AVENGERS

          EXT. RUSSIA, SOLENSKI PLAZA, 3RD FLOOR Â­ NIGHT

          Out in the outskirts, near a railroad, a still in construction
          building is being occupied by GEORGI LUCHKOV, a LARGE, RUSSIAN
          GENERAL along with his THUGS.
          TALL THUG is in the middle of a brutal beating on NATASHA
          ROMANOFF, a SLEWING, FOXY, UNBELIEVABLY SEXY SPY. He BACKHANDS
          NATASHA'S face. She feels the pain, but does not breakdown.
          LUCHKOV, smiling, walks up to her. Dialogue is in RUSSIAN.

                          LUCHKOV
           This is not how I wanted the evening to
           go.

                          NATASHA
           I know how you wanted this evening to
           go. Believe me, this is better.

                          LUCHKOV
           I'd like to know why they sent you to
           carry out a carrier, a stained glass
           and other random items.
          TALL THUG rocks her chair back, balancing her off the edge of an
          open floor. Natasha is now scared.

                          NATASHA
           I thought General Soholob was in charge
           of the export business.

                          LUCHKOV
           Soholob? Your reputation is quite a
           progression. THE FAMOUS BLACK WIDOW.
           Nothing but a pretty face.

                          NATASHA
           You really think I'm pretty?
          LUCHKOV slowly walks over to a table filled with tools. He picks
          up a pair of pliers. TALL THUG opens up her mouth wide open.

                          LUCHKOV
           We do not need the Lermontov to
           transfer the tanks. Tell him, well,...

                          (IN ENGLISH)
           You may have to write it down.
          Suddenly, WEASELLY THUG'S cell rings. Confused, he answers.

                          WEASELLY THUG
           Ya?
           (looks at LUCHKOV)
           It's for you.
          LUCHKOV takes the phone, pissed.

                          LUCHKOV
           Who the hell is...

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           You're at 114 Solenski Plaza, 3rd floor.
           We have an F22 exactly 8 miles out. Put
           the woman on the phone or I will blow
           up the block before you can make the
           lobby.
          HOLY SHIT. LUCHKOV places the cell phone against Natasha's ear
          seeing how she's tied to a chair with her hands tied behind her
          back.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           We need you to come in.

                          NATASHA
           Are you kidding? I'm working!

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           This takes precedence.

                          NATASHA
           I'm in the middle of an interrogation
           and this moron is giving me everything.

                          LUCHKOV
           I don't give everything.
          Natasha gives him a look.

                          NATASHA
           Look, you can't pull me out of this
           right now.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           Natasha. Barton's been compromised.
          A beat.

                          NATASHA
           Let me put you on hold.
          She nods to LUCHKOV. As Luchkov comes to take the phone off her,
          Natasha HITS him with her leg and HEADBUUTS him. Like a spider,
          she stands up elegantly and starts ATTACKING TALL THUG by
          KICKBOXING him in the face.
          Still tied, she ROLLS over WEASELLY THUG after she trips him.
          She then STOMPS on TALL THUG foot with peg of the chair, then

          KNOCKS HIM OUT WITH HER HEAD.
          Yeah, during all this Coulson is still waiting on the line. She
          then FLIPS over and FALLS down hard on WEASELLY THUG, BREAKING
          THE CHAIR. She sees TALL THUG stand.
          Giving her momentum, she runs at him DROP KICKING him, FALLS
          DOWN and FLIPS right back up and WRAPS HER LEGS AROUND HIS NECK

          AND KNOCKS HIM OUT COLD.
          She grabs LUCHKOV, wraps his leg around with a hanging chain and
          drops him down the open floor, dangling. She picks up the phone
          and her heels, like a boss.

                          NATASHA
           Where's Barton now?

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           We don't know.

                          NATASHA
           But he's alive.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           We think so. I'll brief you on
           everything when you get back. But
           first, we need you to talk to the big
           guy.

                          NATASHA
           Coulson, you know that Stark trusts me
           about as far as he can throw me.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           No, I've got Stark. You get the big
           guy.

                          NATASHA
           Bozhe moi.

          EXT. INDIAN SLUM Â­ NIGHT

          A LITTLE GIRL runs through the crowd, trying to force a way
          through.

          INT. SHACK Â­ NIGHT

          A tiny shack. The LITTLE GIRL runs up the steps, only to be
          stopped by an attending woman. Then, the LITTLE GIRL spots him.
          BRUCE BANNER, their LOCAL doctor.

                          ATTENDING WOMAN
           What are doing here?! Get out! You
           shouldn't be here!

                          LITTLE GIRL
           I have to see the doctor! It's my
           father!

                          BANNER
           Calm down. What's wrong?

                          LITTLE GIRL
           My father...
          Banner looks behind him seeing how the girl is staring at a few
          people, lying down, looking very sick.

                          BANNER
           Is he like them?
          The LITTLE GIRL holds out all the money she has in the world.

                          LITTLE GIRL
           Please.

          EXT. SLUMS Â­ CONTINUOUS

          Banner and the LITTLE GIRL hastily run nearly to the edge of
          town. The LITTLE GIRL gets ahead of herself. Banner spots local
          government car, he turns around, blocking any view of him.

          EXT/INT. LITTLE GIRL'S SHACK Â­ NIGHT

          Banner quickly follows the LITTLE GIRL inside her house. As he
          walks in, the LITTLE GIRL ESCAPES THROUGH THE WINDOW. Banner is
          left standing there like a dumbass.

                          BANNER
           Should have got paid up front, Banner.
          Natasha then appears from behind the curtains. Banner turns
          around, quietly.

                          NATASHA
           You know, for a man who's supposed to
           be avoiding stress, you picked a hell
           of a place to settle.

                          BANNER
           Avoiding stress isn't the secret.

                          NATASHA
           Then, what is it? Yoga?

                          BANNER
           You brought me to the edge of the city,
           smart. I uh... assume the whole place
           is surrounded?

                          NATASHA
           Just you and me.

                          BANNER
           And your actress buddy, is she a spy
           too? Do they start that young?

                          NATASHA
           I did.

                          BANNER
           Who are you?

                          NATASHA
           Natasha Romanoff.

                          BANNER
           Are you here to kill me, Miss Romanoff?
           Because that's not gonna work out for
           everyone.

                          NATASHA
           No. No. Of course not. I'm here on
           behalf of SHIELD.

                          BANNER
           SHIELD. How did they find me?

                          NATASHA
           We never lost you, doctor. We've kept
           our distance, even helped keep some
           other interested parties off your
           scent.

                          BANNER
           Why?

                          NATASHA
           Nick Fury seems to trust you. But now I
           need you to come in.

                          BANNER
           What if I said no?

                          NATASHA
           I'll persuade you.

                          BANNER
           And what if the... other guy says no?

                          NATASHA
           You've been more than a year without an
           incident. I don't think you wanna break
           that streak.

                          BANNER
           I don't always get what I want.

                          NATASHA
           Doctor, we're facing a potential global
           catastrophe.

                          BANNER
           Well, those I actively try to avoid.

                          NATASHA
           This is the Tesseract. It has the
           potential energy to wipe out the
           planet.
          She shows him a photo of the Tesseract on her cell phone. Banner
          takes a closer look.

                          BANNER
           What does Fury want me to do? Swallow
           it?

                          NATASHA
           Well, he wants you to find it. It's
           been taken. It emits a gamma signature
           that's too weak for us to trace.
           There's no one that knows gamma
           radiation like you do. If there was,
           that's where I'd be.

                          BANNER
           So Fury isn't after the monster?

                          NATASHA
           Not that he's told me.

                          BANNER
           And he tells you everything?

                          NATASHA
           Talk to Fury, he needs you on this.

                          BANNER
           He needs me in a cage?

                          NATASHA
           No one's gonna put you in a...

                          BANNER

           STOP LYING TO ME!
          The THUNDEROUS TONE in is voice makes Natasha QUICKLY grab her
          gun and point it at him, but something is now OFF in the
          atmosphere. Banner stands straight up, smiling.

                          BANNER
           I'm sorry, that was mean. I just wanted
           to see what you'd do. Why don't we do
           this the easy way, where you don't use
           that, and the other guy doesn't make a
           mess? Okay? Natasha...
          Natasha, still wary, doesn't lower her gun. She lowers her gun
          and speaks into her earpiece.

                          NATASHA
           Stand down. We're good here.

          EXT. OUTSIDE THE LITTLE GIRL'S SHACK Â­ NIGHT

          Amazingly, DOZENS OF SHIELD AGENTS are surrounding the shack
          outside.

          INT. LITTLE GIRL'S SHACK Â­ NIGHT

          Banner looks at Natasha, charming a smile at her.

                          BANNER
           Just you and me?
          Natasha fidgets now that she exposed her guard down.

          INT. SHIELD ANALYTICAL ROOM Â­ NIGHT

          Fury is facing several LARGE MONITORS as he as a conference with
          members of the WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1
           This is out of line, Director. You're
           dealing with forces you can't control.

                          NICK FURY
           You ever been in a war, Councilman? In
           a firefight? Did you feel an
           overabundance of control?

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1
           You saying that this Asgard has
           declared war on our planet?

                          NICK FURY
           Not Asgard. Loki.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #2
           He can't be working alone. What about
           the other one? His brother.

                          NICK FURY
           Our intelligence says, Thor is not a
           hostile. But he's worlds away, we can't
           depend on him to help. It's up to us.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1
           Which is why you should be focusing on
           phase 2, it was designed for exactly...

                          NICK FURY
           PHASE 2 isn't ready, our enemy is. We
           need a response team.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1
           The Avengers Initiative was shut down.

                          NICK FURY
           This isn't about The Avengers.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1
           We're running the world's greatest
           covert security network and you're
           gonna leave the fate of human race to a
           handful of freaks.

                          NICK FURY
           I'm not leaving anything to anyone. We
           need a response team. These people
           maybe isolated, unbalanced even, but I
           believe with the right push they can be
           exactly what we need.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #2
           You believe?

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1
           War isn't won by sentiment, Director.

                          NICK FURY
           No, it's won by soldiers.

          INT. BROOKLYN GYM Â­ NIGHT

          Somewhere in an old, almost WWII-esque boxing gym, STEVE ROGERS,
          a man out of time, THE FIRST AVENGER, FUCKIN' CAPTAIN AMERICA is
          PUMMELING a punching bag. With every swing, it's like a memory
          he's trying to fight off and repress.

          EXT. HYDRA BASE Â­ DAY (FLASHBACK)

          Captain America is running through the forest, dodging mortars,
          gunfire and the Tesseract's energy firearms.

           STEVE (V.O.)
           There's not enough time! I gotta put
           her in the water!

          INT. BROOKLYN GYM Â­ NIGHT

          Steve's rage keeps building as he punches the bag. It gets
          harder...

          INT. HORTEN H.XVIII, RED SKULL'S SHIP Â­ DAY (FLASHBACK)

          Steve places his COMPASS with an image of PEGGY CARTER. The time
          is here for him to crash the plane.

          INT. BROOKLYN GYM Â­ NIGHT

          Steve closes his eyes. Goes at the bag harder.

           PEGGY (V.O.)
           You won't be alone.

          INT. HORTEN H.XVIII, RED SKULL'S SHIP Â­ DAY (FLASHBACK)

          The RED SKULL picks up the TESSERACT.

          INT. BROOKLYN GYM Â­ NIGHT

          Steve opens his eyes and fuckin' tears the bag as the last
          memory kicks in. I don't think he can physically stop...

           SHIELD SCIENTIST (V.O.)
           Oh my god!

          INT. PROJECT P.E.G.A.S.U.S, ANTARCTICA Â­ DAY (FLASHBACK)

          A half frozen Steve Roger is lying down on a medical slab. Two
          SHIELD SCIENTISTS run over hi-tech devices to see if his vitals
          are up. And it seems...

                          SHIELD SCIENTIST
           This guy is still alive!

          INT. BROOKLYN GYM Â­ NIGHT

          Steve FUCKING tears the bag open, off its chain, spilling out
          the sand. He stands, breathing hard, letting out 70 years of
          over repressed feeling.
          After taking a few breathers, Steve picks up another punching
          bag, which is laying next another DOZEN BAGS. He hooks the bag
          up and starts punching again. Fury walks in.

                          NICK FURY
           Trouble sleeping?

                          STEVE
           I slept for seventy years, sir. I think
           I've had my fill.

                          NICK FURY
           Then you should be out, celebrating,
           seeing the world.
          Steve stops punching and walks over to the bench, unraveling the
          tape off his hands. He sits down.

                          STEVE
           I went under, the world was at war, I
           wake up, they say we won. They didn't
           say what we lost.

                          NICK FURY
           We've made some mistakes along the way.
           Some very recently.

                          STEVE
           You here with a mission, sir?

                          NICK FURY
           I am.

                          STEVE
           Trying to get me back in the world?

                          NICK FURY
           Trying to save it.
          Fury hands Steve a file on the Tesseract, along with other files
          on HYDRA'S projects.

                          STEVE
           Hydra's secret weapon.

                          NICK FURY
           Howard Stark fished that out of the
           ocean when he was looking for you. He
           thought what we think, the Tesseract
           could be the key to unlimited
           sustainable energy. That's something
           the world sorely needs.

                          STEVE
           Who took it from you?

                          NICK FURY
           He's called Loki. He's not from around
           here. There's a lot we'll have to bring
           you up to speed on if you're in. The
           world has gotten even stranger than you
           already know.

                          STEVE
           At this point, I doubt anything would
           surprise me.

                          NICK FURY
           Ten bucks says you're wrong. There's a
           debriefing package waiting for you back
           at your apartment.
          Steve turns and picks up a punching bag. Starts walking out of
          the gym.

                          NICK FURY
           Is there anything you can tell us about
           the Tesseract that we ought to know
           now?

                          STEVE
           You should have left it in the ocean.

          INT. OCEAN Â­ NIGHT

          Out in the Atlantic Ocean, TONY STARK, in his IRON MAN suit, is
          cutting a PIPELINE TRANSPORT with a laser cutter coming from his
          hand. He then places a STARK ENERGY REACTOR. It lights up. IRON
          MAN rockets out of the water and flies towards STARK TOWER.

                          TONY
           You're good on this end. The rest is up
           to you.

                          PEPPER POTTS
           (on the other line)
           You disconnected the transition lines?
           Are we off the grid?

          INSIDE THE SUIT -- PEPPER APPEARS ON HIS HUD MONITOR.

                          TONY
           Stark Tower is about to become a beacon
           of self-sustaining clean energy.

                          PEPPER
           Wow. So maybe our reactor takes over
           and it actually works?

                          TONY
           I assume. Light her up.
          As IRON MAN flies to the STARK TOWER BUILDING, the power is
          switched on and the STARK sign LIGHTS UP.

                          PEPPER
           How does it look?

                          TONY
           Like Christmas, but with more... me.

                          PEPPER
           Gotta go wider on the public awareness
           campaign. You need to do some press. I
           can do some more tomorrow. I'm working
           on the zoning for the next billboards.

                          TONY
           Pepper, you're killing me. Remember?
           Enjoy the moment.

                          PEPPER
           Then get in here and I will.
          TONY arrives at his skyscraper penthouse and is in the process
          of taking off his IRON MAN suit through a hi-tech gauntlet of
          gadgets.

                          JARVIS
           Sir, Agent Coulson of SHIELD is on the
           line.

                          TONY
           I'm not in. I'm actually out.

                          JARVIS
           Sir, I'm afraid he's insisting.

                          TONY
           Close the line Jarvis. I got a date.

          INT. TONY'S PENTHOUSE Â­ NIGHT

          PEPPER POTTS stares up at the monitors of the reactor device.

                          PEPPER
           Levels are holding steady... I think.

                          TONY
           Of course they are, I was directly
           involved. Which brings me to my next
           question: how does it feel to be a
           genius?

                          PEPPER
           Well, ha, I really wouldn't know now,
           would I?

                          TONY
           What do you mean? All this came from
           you.

                          PEPPER
           No. All this came from that.
          Points to the energy in his chest plate.

                          TONY
           Give yourself some credit, please.
           Stark Tower is your baby. Give
           yourself... twelve percent of the
           credit.

                          PEPPER
           Twelve percent?

                          TONY
           An argument can be made for fifteen.

                          PEPPER
           Twelve percent? For my baby?

                          TONY
           Well, I did do all the heavy lifting.
           Literally, I lifted the heavy things.
           And sorry, but the security snafu? That
           was on you.

                          PEPPER
           Oooooh.

                          TONY
           My private elevator...

                          PEPPER
           You mean OUR elevator?

                          TONY
           ...was teeming with sweaty workmen. I'm
           going to pay for that comment about
           percentages in some subtle way later,
           aren't I?
          Pepper pours herself and Tony a glass of champagne.

                          PEPPER
           Not gonna be that subtle.

                          TONY
           I'll tell you what. Next building's
           gonna say 'Potts' on the tower.

                          PEPPER
           On the lease.

                          TONY
           ...Call your mom, can you bunk over?

                          JARVIS
           Sir, the telephone. I'm afraid my
           protocols are being overwritten.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           Stark, we need to talk. Tony picks up
           his phone and looks into it at Coulson.

                          TONY
           You have reached the life model decoy
           of Tony Stark, please leave a message.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           This is urgent.

                          TONY
           Then leave it urgently.
          At that moment the elevator door opens and Coulson appears.

                          TONY
           Security breach.

                          (TO PEPPER)
           That's on you.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           Mr. Stark.

                          PEPPER
           Phil! Come in.

                          TONY
           Phil? Uh, his first name is Agent.

                          PEPPER
           Come on in, we're celebrating.

                          TONY
           Which is why he can't stay.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           We need you to look this over.
           (he holds out a file towards

                          STARK)
           Soon as possible.

                          TONY
           I don't like being handed things.

                          PEPPER
           That's alright, `cause I love to be
           handed things. So, let's trade.
          She passes her glass of champagne to Coulson and takes the file
          from him, then takes her champagne glass back from Coulson and
          passes the file over to Stark.

                          PEPPER
           Thank you.

                          TONY
           Official consulting hours are between
           eight and five every other Thursday.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           This isn't a consultation.

                          PEPPER
           Is this about The Avengers? Which I...I
           know nothing about.

                          TONY
           The Avengers Initiative was scrapped, I
           thought. And I didn't even qualify.

                          PEPPER
           I didn't know that either.

                          TONY
           Yeah, apparently I'm volatile, self-
           obsessed, don't play well with others.

                          PEPPER
           That I did know.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           This isn't about personality profiles
           anymore.

                          TONY
           Whatever. Miss Potts, got a minute?
          Pepper walks over to Tony who places the files into his own
          databases.

                          TONY
           You know, I thought we were having a
           moment.

                          PEPPER
           I was having twelve percent of a
           moment. This seems serious, Phil's
           pretty shaken.

                          TONY
           How did you notice? Why is he Phil?

                          PEPPER
           What is all of this?

                          TONY
           This is, uh...
          Tony EXPANDS his arms and different profiles appear in
          holographic form floating in the air in front of Tony and
          Pepper.

                          TONY
           This.
          Screens appear of CAPTAIN AMERICA IN ACTION, the HULK ROARING AS

          HE ATTACKS THE ARMY AT CULVER UNIVERSITY, THOR FIGHTING THE
          DESTROYER and another is of Loki and the Tesseract, to which
          Stark and Pepper look on in awe.

                          PEPPER
           I'm going to take the jet to D.C.
           tonight.

                          TONY
           Tomorrow.

                          PEPPER
           You've got homework. You've got a lot
           of homework.

                          TONY
           Well, what if I didn't?

                          PEPPER
           If you didn't?

                          TONY
           Yeah.

                          PEPPER
           You mean if you finished?
           (Stark nods his head)
           Well, um...then...
          She whispers something in his ear. Tony GASPS. Coulson looks
          away in embarrassment.

                          TONY
           Square deal. It's the last date.
          Pepper kisses him.

                          PEPPER
           Work hard.
          As Pepper leaves with Agent Coulson, Tony grabs the Tesseract in
          holograph form, worried.

          INT. QUINJET Â­ DAY

          Inside the QUINJET, Steve is sitting down, holding a TABLET,
          watching the footage of the Hulk's attack on the Army at Culver
          University.

                          PILOT
           We're about forty minutes out from
           base, sir.
          Agent Coulson stands up from his seat and walks over to Steve.

                          STEVE
           So, this Doctor Banner was trying to
           replicate the serum that was used on
           me?

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           A lot of people were. You were the
           world's first superhero. Banner thought
           gamma radiation might hold the key to
           unlocking Erskine's original formula.
          The Hulk roars with fury as he slams a jeep apart.

                          STEVE
           Didn't really go his way, did it?

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           Not so much. When he's not that thing
           though, guy's like a Stephen Hawking.
          Steve looks confused.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           He's like a smart person. I gotta say,
           it's an honor to meet you, officially.
          Steve smiles at Coulson.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           I sort of met you, I mean, I watched
           you while you were sleeping.
          Steve looks down. He stands up, closes his laptop and walks to
          the side with Coulson following.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           I mean, I was... I was present while
           you were unconscious from the ice. You
           know, it's really, it's just a... just
           a huge honor to have you on board.

                          STEVE
           Well, I hope I'm the man for the job.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           Oh, you are. Absolutely. Uh... we've
           made some modifications to the uniform.
           I had a little design input.

                          STEVE
           The uniform? Aren't the stars and
           stripes a little... old fashioned?

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           With everything that's happening, the
           things that are about to come to light,
           people might just need a little old
           fashioned.
          Steve takes in Coulson's sentiment.

          INT. UNDERGROUND LAB Â­ DAY

          Several soldiers under Loki's mind control run around, preparing
          to infiltrate whatever Loki has planned. Loki sits down,
          watching Selvig work with a CMS device. Loki meditates, until...

          EXT. THRONE ROOM Â­ NIGHT

          ...the scepter materializes him back into the throne room of THE
          OTHER, fully armed in his horned helmet and armor. THE OTHER
          appears from the steps.

                          THE OTHER
           The Chitauri grow restless.

                          LOKI
           Let them go at themselves. I will lead
           them into glorious battle.

                          THE OTHER
           Battle? Against the meager might of
           Earth?

                          LOKI
           Glorious, not lengthy. If your force is
           as formidable as you claim.

                          THE OTHER
           You question us? You question HIM? He,
           who put the scepter in your hand, who
           gave you ancient knowledge and new
           purpose when you were cast out,
           defeated?

                          LOKI
           I was a king! The rightful king of
           Asgard! Betrayed!

                          THE OTHER
           Your ambition is little, born of
           childish need. We look beyond the Earth
           to greater worlds the Tesseract will
           unveil.

                          LOKI
           You don't have the Tesseract yet.
          THE OTHER runs over to attack him, but stops as Loki points his
          scepter.

                          LOKI
           I don't threaten, but until I open the
           doors, until your force is mine to
           command, you are but words.

                          THE OTHER
           You will have your war, Asgardian. If
           you fail, if the Tesseract is kept from
           us, there will be no realm, no barren
           moon, no crevice where he can't find
           you. You think you know pain? He will
           make you long for something as sweet as
           pain.
          THE OTHER places his hand on Loki's head and transports him back
          to Earth. Loki looks around, menacing.

          EXT. HELICARRIER LANDING STRIP Â­ DAY

          The QUINJET lands down a MASSIVE BATTLESHIP known as the
          HELICARRIER. It has two runways. One with direct access to a
          hangar at the rear is aligned along the spine of the vessel.
          Agent Coulson and Steve walk down the ramp, meeting up with
          Natasha.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           Agent Romanoff. Captain Rogers.

                          STEVE
           Ma'am?

                          NATASHA
           Hi.

                          (TO COULSON)
           They need you on the bridge. Face time.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           See you there.
          Agent Coulson walks away leaving Steve with Natasha, walking
          towards the railing of the ship.

                          NATASHA
           There was quite the buzz around here,
           finding you in the ice. I thought
           Coulson was gonna swoon. Did he ask you
           to sign his Captain America trading
           cards yet?

                          STEVE
           Trading cards?

                          NATASHA
           They're vintage, he's very proud.
          Without realizing, Banner doesn't notice them walking as he
          isnervous as hell. He moves around as people keep walking in
          hisway.

                          STEVE
           Dr. Banner.
          Steve walks up to Banner and shakes his hands.

                          BANNER
           Oh, yeah. Hi. They told me you'd be
           coming.

                          STEVE
           Word is you can find the cube.

                          BANNER
           Is that the only word on me?

                          STEVE
           Only word I care about.

                          BANNER
           (takes in the sentiment)
           Must be strange for you, all of this.

                          STEVE
           Well, this is actually kind of
           familiar.

                          NATASHA
           Gentlemen, you may wanna step inside in
           a minute. It's gonna get a little hard
           to breath.
          Suddenly the HELICARRIER starts SHAKING as it prepares to fly
          "sail."

                          STEVE
           Is this is a submarine?

                          BANNER
           Really? They wanted me in a submerged
           pressurized metal container?
          They both move closer to the edge of the HELICARRIER. FOUR HUGE

          LIFT FANS MOUNTED ON THE SIDES STARTS TO LIFT INTO THE AIR IN
          VTOL FLIGHT. Steve watches in AWE as Banner smiles.

                          BANNER

           OH, NO. THIS IS MUCH WORSE.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE Â­ DAY

          The doors part and we enter THE BRIDGE OF THE SHIP Â­ a flurry of
          activity Â­ dozens of agents sit in front of their VIEWSCREENS.
          Agent Hill shouts her instructs to leave. Turns to NICK FURY,
          who is at the command chair.

           AGENT MARIA HILL
           We're at lock, sir.

                          NICK FURY
           Good. Let's vanish.

          EXT. SKY

          The HELICARRIER rises high into the heavens. Suddenly, the
          entire ship is covered in reflecting mirrors, which then
          camouflages in the sky.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE Â­ CONTINUOUS

          Steve and Banner walk through the glorious, gleaming bridge,
          taking his position at the SCIENCE CONSOLE.

                          NICK FURY
           Gentlemen.
          Steve gives Fury 10 bucks, referring to his earlier statement
          about never being surprised again. Fury walks over Banner and
          extends his hand. Banner, reluctantly shakes it.

                          NICK FURY
           Doctor, thank you for coming.

                          BANNER
           Thanks for asking nicely. So, uh... how
           long am I staying?

                          NICK FURY
           Once we get our hands on the Tesseract,
           you're in the clear.

                          BANNER
           Where are you with that?
          Nick Fury turns to Agent Coulson to explain, while Natasha
          Romanoff eyes an image of Clint Barton on a computer screen.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           We're sweeping every wirelessly
           accessible camera on the planet.
           Cellphones, laptops. If it's connected
           to a satellite, it's eyes and ears for
           us.

                          NATASHA
           That's still not gonna find them in
           time.

                          BANNER
           You have to narrow the field. How many
           spectrometers do you have access to?

                          NICK FURY
           How many are there?

                          BANNER
           Call every lab you know, tell them to
           put the spectrometers on the roof and
           calibrate them for gamma rays. I'll
           rough out a tracking algorithm based on
           cluster recognition. At least we could
           rule out a few places. Do you have
           somewhere for me to work?

                          NICK FURY
           Agent Romanoff, would you show
           Dr.Banner to his laboratory, please.
          Natasha nods and walks off, leading Banner down the hall.

                          NATASHA
           You're gonna love it, Doc. We got all
           the toys.

          INT. UNDERGROUND LAB, VACUUM ROOM Â­ DAY

          Selvig and several scientists work around the CMS device.
          Bartonwalks in, holding a tablet.

                          SELVIG
           Put it over there!

                          (TO BARTON)
           Where did you find all these people?

                          CLINT BARTON
           SHIELD has not shortage of enemies,
           Doctor.
          He holds up a screen showing information on IRIDIUM.

                          CLINT BARTON
           Is this the stuff you need?

                          SELVIG
           Yeah, iridium. It's found in
           meteorites, it forms anti-protons. It's
           very hard to get hold of.

                          CLINT BARTON
           Especially if SHIELD knows you need it.

                          SELVIG
           Well, I didn't know!
           (sees Loki coming)
           Hey! The Tesseract is showing me so
           much. It's more than just knowledge,
           it's... truth.

                          LOKI
           I know. What did it show you, Agent
           Barton?

                          CLINT BARTON
           My next target.

                          LOKI
           Tell me what you need.

                          CLINT BARTON
           I'll need a distraction.
           (grabs his bow)
           And an eyeball.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE Â­ NIGHT

          As they are waiting to locate Loki using satellite facial
          recognition, Coulson and Steve stand side by side, waiting.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           I mean, if it's not too much trouble.

                          STEVE
           No, no. It's fine.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           It's a vintage set. It took me a couple
           of years to collect them all. Near
           mint, slight foxing around the edges,
           but...

           AGENT JASPER SITWELL
           We got a hit. Sixty-seven percent
           match. Weight, cross match, seventy-
           nine percent.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           Location?

           AGENT JASPER SITWELL
           Stuttgart, Germany. 28, Konigstrasse.
           He's not exactly hiding.

                          NICK FURY
           Captain, you're up.
          Steve nods. Leaves.

          EXT. STUTTGART MUSEUM Â­ NIGHT

          Loki standing in front of the museum, dressed in 21st century
          attire and with the scepter, disguised as a cane, walks up to
          the entrance of the gala.

          INT. STUTTGART GALA Â­ NIGHT

          Inside, a lavished gala with an orchestra playing, is
          interrupted as the HEAD DOCTOR walks up to the mic.

          INT. HELICARRIER, STEVE'S LOCKER Â­ NIGHT

          Steve walks into his own locker room. As he approaches to the
          steel cabinet, the doors already reveal the updated CAPTAIN
          AMERICA UNIFORM, along with the famous SHIELD. He stands in
          silence.

          EXT. STUTTGART MUSEUM Â­ NIGHT

          Outside the museum, GERMAN GUARDS stand in their positions. One
          of them is standing on top of the roof, scoping. He then hears a

          THWACK!
          He looks down. One of his guards is shot with an ARROW. He
          raises his gun. He is shot dead by an arrow. Falls down. Barton
          and his CREW arrive at the doors of the locked science building.
          Barton looks at the retinal scanner. He pulls out a SHIELD eye
          scanner instrument.

          INT. STUTTGART GALA Â­ NIGHT

          Loki looks from above the museum and descends down to where the
          HEAD DOCTOR is. As he makes it down and near the stage, he FLIPS
          his cane the other end. The guard there notices him, pulls out
          his gun, but Loki CLUBS his head in. CHAOS ERUPTS.
          Guests begin to leave the museum. Loki grabs the doctor and
          flips him over onto a marble table of the mythological creatures
          BILCHSTEIM. Loki pulls out an OPTICAL TORTURE DEVICE. He PLUNGES
          down the doctor's eye. The doctor TWISTS in pain.

          EXT. STUTTGART MUSEUM Â­ NIGHT

          Suddenly, from Barton's instrument, a holographic eye of the
          head doctor appears and the image of the doctor appears on
          screen.
          The doors to the facility open. Barton walks in and finds in a
          cabinet, a glass thermos with a cylinder of iridium.

          EXT. STUTTGART GALA Â­ NIGHT

          As the crowd runs away, Loki slowly walks out and materializes
          in his gold armor and helmet. The POLICE arrive and with no
          hesitation, he BLASTS the cars, FLIPPING them over and over.

                          LOKI
           Kneel before me.
          The crowd ignores him. Another LOKI appears, blocking the crowd.
          Loki after Loki appears, they all grin as they raise their
          spears, encircling the crowd.

                          LOKI
           I said. KNEEL!!!
          Everyone becomes quiet and kneels in front him. Loki embracing
          his arms out, smiling.

                          LOKI
           Is not this simpler? Is this not your
           natural state? It's the unspoken truth
           of humanity, that you crave
           subjugation. The bright lure of freedom
           diminishes your life's joy in a mad
           scramble for power, for identity. You
           were made to be ruled. In the end, you
           will always kneel.
          As the words resonate to the kneeling crowd, an ELDER GERMAN MAN
          refuses to kneel and stands, heroic.

           ELDER GERMAN MAN
           Not to men like you.

                          LOKI
           There are no men like me.

           ELDER GERMAN MAN
           There are always men like you.

                          LOKI
           Look to your elder, people. Let him be
           an example.
          Loki is about to execute him with his scepter as the light GLOWS
          blue. Just as the ENERGY BEAM shoots out, FUCKING CAPTAIN
          AMERICA arrives! He dives in just in time and BLOCKS the blast
          with his SHIELD, knocking down Loki on his ass.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           You know, the last time I was in
           Germany and saw a man standing above
           everybody else, we ended up
           disagreeing.

                          LOKI

                          (STANDING UP)
           The soldier. A man out of time.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           I'm not the one who's out of time.
          From above Cap, the QUINJET arrives. A machine gun is pointed
          towards Loki.

                          NATASHA
           Loki, drop the weapon and stand down.
          Like greased lighting, Loki sends a BLAST of blue at the
          QUINJET. Natasha MANEUVERS it just in time, giving Cap the time
          to throw his shield at Loki. They both begin to DUKE IT OUT.
          Loki FLINGS Cap to the ground. Cap then throws his shield, but
          Loki SWATS it way. Cap, using all the moves of a boxer, is
          KNOCKED down by Loki. Standing over him, he points the scepter's
          tip on his helmet.

                          LOKI
           Kneel.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Not today!
          Cap FLIPS and KNOCKS him out with his leg. Loki grabs him and
          FLIPS him over.

          INT. QUINJET Â­ NIGHT


                          NATASHA
           The guy's all over the place.
          Suddenly, AC/DC's "Shoot to Thrill" overdrives the QUINJET'S
          speakers.

                          IRON MAN
           Agent Romanoff, did you miss me?
          Both Cap and Loki look up at the sky. Tony flies over in his
          IRON MAN suit and blasts Loki right back to the ground. IRON MAN
          touches down. He stands up and pulls out every piece of weaponry
          the suit has.

                          IRON MAN
           Make your move, Reindeer Games.
          Loki puts up his hands and surrenders. His armor materializes
          away.

                          IRON MAN
           Good move.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Mr. Stark.

                          IRON MAN
           Captain.

          INT. QUINJET Â­ NIGHT

          Natasha watches the skies. THUNDER. Coming out of nowhere. Fury
          speaks over her headset.

           NICK FURY (V.O.)
           Said anything?

                          NATASHA
           Not a word.

           NICK FURY (V.O.)
           Just get him here. We're low on time.
          With Loki tied up and cuffed to his seat, Tony and Steve watch
          from a distance, whispering.

                          STEVE
           I don't like it.

                          TONY
           What? Rock of Ages giving up so easily?

                          STEVE
           I don't remember it being ever that
           easy. This guy packs a wallop.

                          TONY
           Still, you are pretty spry, for an
           older fellow. What's your thing?
           Pilates?

                          STEVE
           What?

                          TONY
           It's like calisthenics. You might have
           missed a couple things, you know, doing
           time as a Capsicle.
          Steve looks at Tony, finally meeting his ego match.

                          STEVE
           Fury didn't tell me he was calling you
           in.

                          TONY
           Yeah, there's a lot of things Fury
           doesn't tell you.
          THUNDER and LIGHTNING nearly hit the jet, making it shake
          violently.

                          NATASHA
           Where's this coming from?
          Thunder RUMBLES overhead. Loki stares out the window intently.

                          STEVE
           What's the matter? Scared of a little
           lightning?

                          LOKI
           I'm not overly fond of what follows.
          What the fuck? OUTSIDE THE JET A BLINDING LIGHT hits the jet.
          Not a light. A King.
          THE MIGHTY THOR. Thor OPENS the ramp and grabs Loki by the
          throat and flies out. Steve and Tony are left dumbstruck. Tony
          puts the IRON MAN helmet on.

                          IRON MAN
           Now there's that guy.

                          NATASHA
           Another Asgardian?

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Think the guy's a friendly?

                          IRON MAN
           Doesn't matter. If he frees Loki or
           kills him, the Tesseract's lost.
          Tony turns and gets ready to jump off the jet to chase after
          Thor.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Stark, we need a plan of attack!

                          IRON MAN
           I have a plan. Attack.
          IRON MAN jumps out of the jet and chases after Thor. Cap grabs a
          parachute to follow.

                          NATASHA
           I'd sit this one out, Cap.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           I don't see how I can.

                          NATASHA
           These guys come from legends, they're
           basically gods.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           There's only one God, ma'am. And I'm
           pretty sure he doesn't dress like that.
          Cap JUMPS OUT of the jet.

          EXT. MOUNTAIN LEDGE Â­ NIGHT

          Somewhere out in the European mountains, Thor throws Loki into
          the side of the mountain. He raises the mighty hammer, MJÃ–LNIR.
          He looks down at his brother, who he thought to be dead and is
          angry to see him alive in this fashion.

                          THOR
           Where is the Tesseract?

                          LOKI

                          (LAUGHS)
           I missed you too.

                          THOR
           Do I look to be in a gaming mood?!

                          LOKI
           Oh, you should thank me. With the
           Bifrost gone how much dark energy did
           the Allfather have to muster to conjure
           you here? Your precious Earth.
          Thor drops MJÃ–LNIR, causing the mountain to quake. He picks up
          Loki. His brother.
          Although Thor is pissed for what he has done, a family is
          everything to a man or god.

                          THOR
           I thought you dead.

                          LOKI
           Did you mourn?

                          THOR
           We all did. Our father...

                          LOKI
           Your father. He did tell you my true
           parentage, did he not?
          Thor lets go Loki, who walks away from Thor, causing an even
          bigger wedge between them.

                          THOR
           We were raised together, we played
           together, we fought together. Do you
           remember none of that?

                          LOKI

                          (TURNS AROUND)
           I remember a shadow. Living in the
           shade of your greatness. I remember you
           tossing me into an abyss. I was and
           should be king!

                          THOR
           So you take the world I love as
           recompense for your imagined slights.
           No, the Earth is under my protection,
           Loki.

                          LOKI

                          (LAUGHS)
           And you're doing a marvelous job with
           that. The humans slaughter each other
           in droves, while you idly threat. I
           mean to rule them. And why should I
           not?

                          THOR
           You think yourself above them.

                          LOKI
           Well, yes.

                          THOR
           Then you miss the truth of ruling,
           brother. Throne would suit you ill.
          Angrily, Loki shoves his brother to the side. He walks back up
          to the ledge. Turns around.

                          LOKI
           I've seen worlds you've never known
           about! I have grown, Odinson, in my
           exile! I have seen the true power of
           the Tesseract, and when I wield it...

                          THOR
           Who showed you this power? Who controls
           the would-be-king?

                          LOKI
           I am a king!

                          THOR
           Not here! You give up the Tesseract!
           You give up this poisonous dream! You
           come home.

                          LOKI
           I don't have it. You need the cube to
           bring me home, but I've sent it off I
           know not where.
          MjÃ¶lnir flies back to his grasp.

                          THOR
           You listen well, brother. I...

          THOR IS KNOCKED OFF THE MOUNTAIN BY IRON MAN WHO TACKLES HIM IN

          MID-FLIGHT.

                          LOKI
           I'm listening.

          EXT. FOREST Â­ CONTINUOUS

          THOR and IRON MAN CRASH into the forest. Thor rolls himself up.
          IRON MAN is still standing, but keeps his distance. The helmet
          opens up.

                          THOR
           Do not touch me again!

                          TONY
           Then don't take my stuff.

                          THOR
           You have no idea what you're dealing
           with.

                          TONY
           Shakespeare in the park? Doth mother
           know you weareth her drapes?

                          THOR
           This is beyond you, metal man. Loki
           will face Asgardian justice!

                          TONY
           He gives up the Cube, he's all yours.
           Until then, stay out of my way...
           tourist.
          The IRON MAN helmet clamps up and he walks away. In one quick
          move, Thor pulls MjÃ¶lnir, throws it, and KNOCKS IRON MAN clear
          across into a tree.

          INSIDE THE SUIT

                          TONY
           Okay.
          From the mountain side, Loki watches in amusement. Thor raises
          his hand. MjÃ¶lnir flies back to his hand. Thor SWINGS the
          hammer, summoning a ray of energy.
          IRON MAN stands up and from his HAND BOOSTERS, a BLAST of ENERGY
          KNOCKS the MIGHTY AVENGER on his ass. IRON MAN flies back up and
          knocks Thor into a tree. Right back at you, bitch!
          Thor, kneeling on the ground, pulls MjÃ¶lnir to his hand, raises
          it to the skies and pulls in LIGHTING and THUNDER! Thor points
          the hammer at IRON MAN and the outpouring of bolts lighting
          increases in intensity. IRON MAN falls back.

          INSIDE THE SUIT

                          JARVIS
           Power at 400% capacity.

                          TONY
           How about that?
          IRON MAN FIRES AWAY FROM HIS HAND BOOSTERS, pushing Thor to his
          knees. Like two gunslingers ready to draw, both Thor and IRON
          MAN fly towards each other and meet in the middle and ascend up.

          EXT. SKY Â­ NIGHT

          The two battle. IRON MAN grasps THOR, elbowing him and SMASHING
          him into the side of a mountain.
          THOR LEAPS off the mountain and takes IRON MAN with him.

          EXT. FOREST Â­ CONTINUOUS

          THOR and IRON MAN crash right back down, smashing down every
          tree possible. IRON MAN YANKS Thor right up. Thor grabs both
          HANDS BOOSTERS and begins to CRUSH them. Tony quickly CHARGES as
          much energy as he can and SHOOTS ENERGY in Thor's face.
          Thor FALLS back, losing his stance. IRON MAN HEADBUTTS Thor,
          with his gold-titanium alloy helmet. Thor... HEADBUTTS him with
          his fuckin' head and actually sends IRON MAN across the forest.
          IRON MAN boosters up and flies back at Thor, grabbing him by the
          arm and cape and SWINGS him into another tree. Thor looks up,
          ready. Thor runs with all his patience out the window. IRON MAN
          SWINGS and MISSES, giving Thor the momentum to grab him, lift
          him and SMASH him down hard.
          Thor summons back MjÃ¶lnir to his hand. Just as he's about to put
          the hammer down, IRON MAN uses his HAND BOOSTERS to SKID across
          the ground and trip Thor over. Standing up, Thor looks for him,
          but from behind him, IRON MAN CRASHES into his back. Thor stands
          facing IRON MAN. Ready to pounce...
          CAPTAIN AMERICA'S shield RICOCHETS off both Thor and IRON MAN,
          stopping them. They look up and see CAPTAIN AMERICA standing on
          top of a fallen tree with the shield back in hand.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Hey! That's enough!
           (comes down; looks at Thor)
           Now, I don't know what you plan on
           doing here.

                          THOR
           I've come here to put an end to Loki's
           schemes!

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Then prove it! Put the hammer down.

                          IRON MAN
           Um, yeah, no! Bad call! He loves his
           hammer!

          THOR BACKHANDS IRON MAN LIKE A PIMP WITH MJÃ–LNIR.
          Thor, losing all tolerance with this SENTENTIAL OF LIBERTY,
          raises the hammer.

                          THOR

                          (TO CAP)
           You want me to put the hammer down?

          THOR LEAPS HIGH INTO THE AIR, RAISING THAT FUCKING HAMMER.
          CAPTAIN AMERICA CROUCHES DOWN and HOLDS UP HIS SHIELD. THOR
          brings that hammer down onto the shield and a MASSIVE IMPLOSION
          OF LIGHT reacts to the vibranium shield creating a MASSIVE

          SHOCKWAVE THAT BLOWS UP ANYTHING STANDING WITHIN A MILE.
          IRON MAN stands up, looking around like `holy shit.' Lying right
          next to him is Cap, who never takes his eye off Thor. Thor looks
          at both men.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Are we done here?

          THOR, CAPTAIN AMERICA AND IRON MAN STAND THERE.

          INT. HELICARRIER HALLWAY Â­ NIGHT

          DOZENS of SHIELD POLICE escort Loki, who is in handcuffs,
          smiling. As they pass the HELICARRIER LAB, Banner stops working
          on the CHITAURI SCEPTER and looks up. Loki eyes him as he walks,
          nodding and smiling. BANNER rubs his head.

          INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION Â­ NIGHT

          Loki is now free from his cuffs and is contained in a LARGE
          GLASS CELL held by HYDRAULIC RIGS. Fury walks up the control
          panel of the cell.

                          NICK FURY
           In case it's unclear. You try to
           escape. You so much as scratch that
           glass.
          Fury presses a button which OPENS UP a HATCH underneath Loki's
          cell. Loki peers as much as he can from the glass.
          Without seeing, the sounds of GUSTING WIND would make man shit
          his pants. Not a god, though.

                          NICK FURY
           Thirty thousand feet, straight down in
           a steel trap. You get how that works?!
          Fury closes the hatch. Points at Loki.

                          NICK FURY
           Ant.
          Then points at the button which would drop Loki into the steel
          trap.

                          NICK FURY
           Boot.

                          LOKI

                          (SMIRKING)
           It's an impressive cage. Not built, I
           think, for me.

                          NICK FURY
           Built for something a lot stronger than
           you.

                          LOKI
           Oh, I've heard.
          Loki looks into the camera.

          INT. BRIEFING ROOM Â­ CONTINUOUS

          The others watch on the monitor Loki getting interrogated.
          Banner looks at the monitor, intently.

          INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION Â­ CONTINUOUS


                          LOKI
           The mindless beast, makes play he's
           still a man. How desperate are you,
           that you call upon such lost creatures
           to defend you?

                          NICK FURY
           How desperate am I? You threaten my
           world with war. You steal a force you
           can't hope to control.

                          (MORE)

           NICK FURY (CONT'D)
           You talk about peace and you kill
           `cause it's fun. You have made me very
           desperate. You might not be glad that
           you did.

                          LOKI
           Ooh. It burns you to come so close. To
           have the Tesseract, to have power,
           unlimited power. And for what? A warm
           light for all mankind to share, and
           then to be reminded what real power is.

                          NICK FURY

                          (SMILING)
           Well, you let me know if Real Power
           wants a magazine or something.
          Fury walks off leaving Loki in his glass cell. Loki looks back
          at the camera, smirking.

          INT. BRIEFING ROOM Â­ CONTINUOUS

          Steve watches until the monitor goes black. Thor, who didn't
          even look, just listened, stands there, torn apart. They all
          just stand there in stunned SILENCE. Finally --

                          BANNER
           He really grows on you, doesn't he?

                          STEVE
           Loki's gonna drag this out. So, Thor,
           what's his play?

                          THOR

                          (COMING TOO)
           He has an army called the Chitauri.
           They're not of Asgard or any world
           known. He means to lead them against
           your people. They will win him the
           earth. In return, I suspect, for the
           Tesseract.

                          STEVE

                          (SERIOUSLY)
           An army? From outer space?

                          BANNER
          So he's building another portal. That's
          what he needs Erik Selvig for.

                          THOR
          Selvig?

                          BANNER
          He's an astrophysicist.

                          THOR
          He's a friend.

                          NATASHA
          Loki has him under some kind of spell,
          along with one of ours.

                          STEVE
          I wanna know why Loki let us take him.
          He's not leading an army from here.

                          BANNER
          I don't think we should be focusing on
          Loki. That guy's brain is a bag full of
          cats, you could smell crazy on him.

                          THOR
          Have care how you speak. Loki is beyond
          reason, but he is of Asgard, and he's
          my brother.

                          NATASHA
          He killed eighty people in two days.

                          THOR
          He's adopted.

                          BANNER
          Iridium, what did they need the Iridium
          for?

                          TONY
          It's a stabilizing agent.
           (walks in with Coulson; to

                          COULSON)
          I'll fly you there. Keep the love
          alive. Means the portal won't collapse
          on itself, like it did at SHIELD.

                          TONY (CONT'D)

                          (TO THOR)
           No hard feelings, Point Break. You've
           got a mean swing.
           (referring to the Iridium)
           Also, it means the portal can open as
           wide, and stay open as long, as Loki
           wants.

                          (TO CREW)
           Uh, raise the mid-mast, ship the top
           sails. That man is playing GALAGA!
           Thought we wouldn't notice. But we did.
           (covering his eye, looks

                          AROUND)
           How does Fury do this?

           AGENT MARIA HILL
           He turns.
          Tony looks around the monitors and places a BUTTON SIZE HACKING
          IMPLANT under Fury's desk, without anyone noticing.

                          TONY
           Well, that sounds exhausting. The rest
           of the raw materials, Agent Barton can
           get his hands on pretty easily. Only
           major component he still needs is a
           power source. A high energy density,
           something to kick start the cube.

           AGENT MARIA HILL
           When did you become an expert in
           thermonuclear astrophysics?

                          TONY
           Last night. The packet, Selvig's notes,
           the Extraction Theory papers. Am I the
           only one who did the reading?

                          STEVE
           Does Loki need any particular kind of
           power source?

                          BANNER
           He's got to heat the cube to a
           hundredand twenty million Kelvin just
           to break through the Coulomb barrier.

                          TONY
           Unless, Selvig has figured out how to
           stabilize the quantum tunneling effect.

                          BANNER
           Well, if he could do that he could
           achieve Heavy Ion Fusion at any reactor
           on the planet.

                          TONY
           Finally, someone who speaks English.

                          STEVE
           Is that what just happened?
          Tony and Banner shake hands. A glimmer in their eyes shines as
          the mutual respect for each other shows.

                          TONY
           It's good to meet you, Dr. Banner.
           You're work on anti-electron collisions
           is unparalleled. And I'm a huge fan of
           the way you lose control and turn into
           an enormous green rage monster.

                          BANNER

                          (LOOKS DOWN)
           Thanks.

                          NICK FURY

                          (WALKING IN)
           Dr. Banner is only here to track the
           cube. I was hoping you might join him.

                          STEVE
           Let's start with that stick of his. It
           may be magical, but it works an awful
           lot like a HYDRA weapon.

                          NICK FURY
           I don't know about that, but it is
           powered by the cube. And I'd like to
           know how Loki used it to turn two of
           the sharpest men I know into his
           personal flying monkeys.

                          THOR
           Monkeys? I do not understand.

                          STEVE
           I do! I understood that reference.
          Tony rolls his eyes, while Cap looks proud of himself.

                          TONY
           Shall we play, doctor?

                          BANNER
           Let's play some.
          As Banner and Tony walk out, the GALAGA PLAYER turns ever so
          discreetly, watches as everyone else disperses and goes back to
          playing.

          INT. BANNER'S LAB - NIGHT (LATER)

          Banner continuously scans with a gamma ray detection scanner on
          the scepter for radiation.
          Tony looks at his monitors, shifting and solving as many
          algorithms and equations.

                          BANNER
           The gamma readings are definitely
           consistent with Selvig's reports on the
           Tesseract. But it's gonna take weeks to
           process.

                          TONY
           If we bypass their mainframe and direct
           a reroute to the Homer cluster, we can
           clock this around six hundred
           teraflops.

                          BANNER
           All I packed was a tooth brush.

                          TONY

                          (SMILES)
           You know, you should come by STARK
           TOWERS sometime. Top ten floors, all
           R&D. You'd love it, it's candy land.

                          BANNER
           Thanks, but the last time I was in New
           York I kind of broke...Harlem.

                          TONY
           Well, I promise a stress free
           environment. No tension. No surprises.
          Suddenly, Tony pokes Banner with a MINIATURE ELECTRICAL PROD.
          Steve walks in on them, pissed at Tony.

                          BANNER

           OW!
          Tony looks at Banner closely.

                          TONY
           Nothing?

                          STEVE

                          (TO BANNER)
           Hey! Are you nuts?

                          TONY
           You really have got a lid on it,
           haven't you? What's your secret? Mellow
           jazz? Bongo drums? Huge bag of weed?

                          STEVE
           Is everything a joke to you?

                          TONY
           Funny things are.

                          STEVE
           Threatening the safety of everyone on
           this ship isn't funny. No offense,
           doctor.

                          BANNER
           No, it's alright. I wouldn't have come
           aboard if I couldn't handle pointy
           things.

                          TONY
           You're tiptoeing, big man. You need to
           strut.

                          STEVE
           And you need to focus on the problem,
           Mr. Stark.

                          TONY
           You think I'm not? Why did Fury call us
           and why now? Why not before? What isn't
           he telling us? I can't do the equation
           unless I have all the variables.

                          STEVE
           You think Fury's hiding something?

                          TONY
           He's a spy. Captain, he's the spy. His
           secrets have secrets.
           (points to Banner)
           It's bugging him too, isn't it?

                          BANNER
           (bobbling the words)
           Uh...I just wanna finish my work here
           and...

                          STEVE
           Doctor?
          A beat.

                          BANNER
           'A warm light for all mankind, Loki's
           jab at Fury about the cube.

                          STEVE
           I heard it.

                          BANNER
           (pointing at Tony)
           Well, I think that was meant for you.
           Even if Barton didn't post that all
           over the news.

                          STEVE
           The Stark Tower? That big ugly
           (Tony gives him a look)
           ...building in New York?

                          BANNER
          It's powered by Stark Reactors, self-
          sustaining energy source. That building
          will run itself for what, a year?

                          TONY
          That's just the prototype. I'm kind of
          the only name in clean energy right
          now.

                          BANNER
           (referring to Tony)
          So, why didn't SHIELD bring him in on
          the Tesseract project? I mean, what are
          they doing in the energy business in
          the first place?

                          TONY
          I should probably look into that once
          my decryption programmer finishes
          breaking into all of SHIELD's secure
          files.

                          STEVE
           (taken by that)
          I'm sorry, did you say...?

                          TONY
          Jarvis has been running it since I hit
          the bridge. In a few hours we'll know
          every dirty secret SHIELD has ever
          tried to hide.
           (holds out a bag of blueberries)
          Blueberry?

                          STEVE
          Yet you're confused about why they
          didn't want you around?

                          TONY
          An intelligence organization that fears
          intelligence? Historically, not
          possible.

                          STEVE
           I think Loki's trying to wind us up.
           This is a man who means to start a war,
           and if don't stay focused, he'll
           succeed. We have orders, we should
           follow them.

                          TONY
           Following is not really my style.

                          STEVE

                          (SMILING)
           And you're all about style, aren't you?

                          TONY
           (a nerve hit)
           Of the people in this room, which one
           is; A. wearing a spangly outfit, and B.
           not of use?

                          BANNER
           Steve, tell me none of this smells a
           little funky to you?
          Steve takes in the possibility, but as an obedient soldier,
          shakes it off.

                          STEVE
           Just find the cube.
          Steve walks out of the lab. Still torn apart by the possibility,
          he walks away, towards the HULL of the ship.

          BACK IN THE LAB

                          TONY
           That's the guy my dad never shut up
           about? Wondering if they shouldn't have
           kept him on ice.

                          BANNER
           The guy's not wrong about Loki. He does
           have the jump on us.

                          TONY
           What he's got is an ACME dynamite kit.

                          TONY (CONT'D)
           It's gonna blow up in his face, and I'm
           gonna be there when it does.

                          BANNER
           And I'll read all about it.

                          TONY
           Uh-huh. Or you'll be suiting up like
           the rest of us.

                          BANNER
           Ah, see. I don't get a suit of armor.
           I'm exposed, like a nerve. It's a
           nightmare.

                          TONY
           You know, I've got a cluster of
           shrapnel, trying every second to crawl
           its way into my heart.
           (points at the MINI-ARC
           REACTOR in his chest)
           This stops it. This little circle of
           light. It's part of me now, not just
           armor. It's a... terrible privilege.

                          BANNER
           But you can control it.

                          TONY
           Because I learned how.

                          BANNER
           It's different.
          Banner tries to read the computer screen, but Tony slides the
          data aside with his finger so the two can see face-to-face.

                          TONY
           Hey, I've read all about your accident.
           That much gamma exposure should have
           killed you.

                          BANNER
           So you're saying that the Hulk... the
           other guy... saved my life?

                          (MORE)

                          BANNER (CONT'D)
           That's nice. It's a nice sentiment.
           Saved it for what?

                          TONY

                          (A BEAT)
           I guess we'll find out.
          Banner and Stark get back to work at their respective computers.

                          BANNER
           You might not like that.

                          TONY
           You just might.

          INT. HULL HANGAR, SECURE STORAGE 10-C Â­ NIGHT

          Steve, with all his MIGHT, slides the HEAVY IRON door and
          STEALTHILY walks in. SECURE STORAGE 10-C is a large warehouse,
          filled with METAL CRATES stacked.
          Steve looks up, seeing another level. He LEAPS up high and holds
          onto the catwalk railing. Steve continues to move forward.

          INT. VAN Â­ NIGHT

          Inside this particular van, Selvig and a few other SOLDIERS are
          driving inside a long tunnel. With the CMS device inside, Selvig
          carefully picks up the small cylinder shape IRIDIUM with metal
          prongs and lightly places it a SLOT within the CMS. THE CMS
          ACCEPTS IT. Selvig looks at it, devilishly smiling.

          INT. BRIEFING ROOM Â­ NIGHT

          On a SHIELD monitor is a photo and record of JANE FOSTER. Thor
          looks at her, remembering. With him is Agent Coulson.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           As soon as Loki took the doctor we
           moved Jane Foster. We've got an
           excellent observatory in Traunsee. She
           was asked to consult there very
           suddenly yesterday. Handsome fee,
           private plane, very remote. She'll be
           safe.

                          THOR
           Thank you. It's no accident Loki taking
           Erik Selvig. I dread what he plans for
           him once he's done. Erik is a good man.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           He talks about you a lot. You changed
           his life. You changed everything around
           here.

                          THOR
           They were better as they were. We
           pretend on Asgard that we're more
           advanced, but we...we come here
           battling like BILCHSTEIM.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           Like what?

                          THOR
           BILCHSTEIM? You know; huge, scaly, big
           antlers. You don't have those?

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           Don't think so.

                          THOR
           They are repulsive, and they trample
           everything in their path.
          Thor walks over to the side of the ship and looks out the
          window, lamenting about what has happened and what may come.

                          THOR
           When I first came to earth, Loki's rage
           followed me here and your people paid
           the price. And now again. In my youth I
           courted war.

           NICK FURY (O.S.)
           War hasn't started yet.

                          (WALKING IN)
           You think you can make Loki tell us
           what the Tesseract is?

                          THOR
           I do not know. Loki's mind is far
           afield, it's not just power he craves,
           it's vengeance upon me. There's no pain
           that would prize his need from him.

                          NICK FURY
           A lot of guys think that, until the
           pain stops.

                          THOR
           What are you asking me to do?

                          NICK FURY
           I'm asking. What are you prepared to
           do?

                          THOR
           Loki is a prisoner.

                          NICK FURY
           Then why do I feel like he's the only
           person on this boat that wants to be
           here?
          Thor doesn't answer.

          INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION Â­ NIGHT

          Loki walks back and forth inside his glass cell. Suddenly, he
          stops.

                          LOKI
           There's not many people that can sneak
           up on me.
           (turns to see NATASHA

                          STANDING THERE)

                          NATASHA
           But you figured I'd come.

                          LOKI
           After. After whatever tortures Fury can
           concoct, you would appear as a friend,
           as a balm. And I would cooperate.

                          NATASHA
          I wanna know what you've done to Agent
          Barton.

                          LOKI
          I'd say I've expanded his mind.

                          NATASHA
          And once you've won. Once you're king
          of the mountain. What happens to his
          mind?

                          LOKI
          Is this love, Agent Romanoff?

                          NATASHA
          Love is for children. I owe him a debt.

                          LOKI

                          (SITTING DOWN)
          Tell me.

                          NATASHA
           (she pulls up a chair as

                          WELL)
          Before I worked for SHIELD, I
          uh...well, I made a name for myself. I
          have a very specific skillset. I didn't
          care who I used it for, or on. I got on
          SHIELD's radar in a bad way. Agent
          Barton was sent to kill me, he made a
          different call.

                          LOKI
          And what will you do if I vow to spare
          him?

                          NATASHA
          Not let you out.

                          LOKI

                          (LAUGHS)
          Ah, no. But I like this. Your world in
          the balance, and you bargain for one
          man?

                          NATASHA
           Regimes fall every day. I tend not to
           weep over that, I'm Russian... or was.

                          LOKI
           What is it you want?

                          NATASHA
           It's really not that complicated. I've
           got red in my ledger, I'd like to wipe
           it out.

                          LOKI
           Can you? Can you wipe out that much
           red? DRAKOV'S daughter? SÃƒO PAULO? THE
           HOSPITAL FIRE? Barton told me
           everything. Your ledger is dripping,
           it's gushing red, and you think saving
           a man no more virtuous than yourself
           will change anything?

                          (STANDING; ANGRY)
           This is the basest sentimentality. This
           is a child at prayer... PATHETIC!

                         INTERCUTS
          - Tony and Banner continuously work at their monitors.

           LOKI (V.O.)
           You lie and kill in the service of
           liars and killers.
          - Agent Hill checks every VIEWSCREEN in the bridge. Fury
          oversees.

           LOKI (V.O.)
           You pretend to be separate, to have
           your own code, something that makes up
           for the horrors. But they are a part of
           you, and they will never go away!
          - Steve opens a STEEL crate. Angry, he looks behind him and
          looks back into the crate. THE CRATE IS FILLED WITH AN ARRAY OF

          HYDRA WEAPONS.

          INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION Â­ NIGHT

          Loki SLAMS his cell, making Natasha FLINCH.

                          LOKI
           I won't touch Barton. Not until I make
           him kill you! Slowly. Intimately. In
           every way he knows you fear! And when
           he'll wake just long enough to see his
           good work, and when he screams, I'll
           split his skull! This is my bargain,
           you mewling quim!
          NATASHA turns around, walks away from Loki, disgusted.

                          NATASHA

                          (QUIETLY; DISTRAUGHT)
           You're a monster.

                          LOKI

                          (LAUGHS)
           No, you brought the monster.

                          NATASHA
           (turns back around; poised)
           So, Banner... that's your play.

                          LOKI

                          (STAGGERED)
           What?

                          NATASHA

                          (ON EARPIECE)
           Loki means to unleash the Hulk. Keep
           Banner in the lab, I'm on my way. Send
           Thor as well.

                          (TO LOKI)
           Thank you for your cooperation.
          Natasha quickly walks out, leaving Loki frozen.

          INT. BANNER'S LAB Â­ MORNING

          Fury walks in SURPRISED to see Tony and Banner stop working on
          the scepter.

                          NICK FURY

                          (ANGRY)
           What are you doing, Mr. Stark?

                          TONY
           Uh...kind of been wondering the same
           thing about you.

                          NICK FURY
           You're supposed to be locating the
           Tesseract.

                          BANNER
           We are. The model's locked and we're
           sweeping for the signature now. When we
           get a hit, we'll have the location
           within half a mile.

                          TONY
           And you'll get your cube back, no muss,
           no fuss.
           (suddenly his monitor show a
           collection of SECRET FILES)
           What is PHASE 2?
          Suddenly, Steve drops a HYDRA ASSAULT RIFLE on the table causing
          Fury, Banner and Tony to turn around. Cap looks pissed.

                          STEVE
           PHASE 2 is SHIELD uses the cube to make
           weapons.

                          (TO TONY)
           Sorry, the computer was moving a little
           slow.

                          NICK FURY
           (trying to explain)
           Rogers, we gathered everything related
           to the Tesseract. This does not mean
           that we're...

                          TONY
           I'm sorry, Nick.
          Tony moves the computer screen towards Fury which shows plans of

          THE WEAPONS.

                          TONY
           What were you lying?

                          STEVE
           I was wrong, director. The world hasn't
           changed a bit.
          At that moment, Thor and Natasha walk into the lab. Natasha
          keeps her eyes right on Banner. Banner looks at her, PISSED.

                          BANNER
           Did you know about this?

                          NATASHA
           You wanna think about removing yourself
           from this environment, doctor?

                          BANNER
           I was in Calcutta, I was pretty well
           removed.

                          NATASHA
           Loki's manipulating you.

                          BANNER
           And you've been doing what exactly?

                          NATASHA
           You didn't come here because I bat my
           eyelashes at you.

                          BANNER
           Yes, and I'm not leaving because
           suddenly you get a little twitchy. I'd
           like to know why SHIELD is using the
           Tesseract to build weapons of mass
           destruction.

                          NICK FURY
           Because of him.
           (pointing at Thor)

                          THOR

                          (STUNNED)
           Me?

                          NICK FURY
          Last year earth had a visitor from
          another planet who had a grudge match
          that leveled a small town. We learned
          that not only are we not alone, but we
          are hopelessly, hilariously, outgunned.

                          THOR
          My people want nothing but peace with
          your planet.

                          NICK FURY
          But you're not the only people out
          there, are you? And, you're not the
          only threat. The world's filling up
          with people who can't be matched, they
          can't be controlled.

                          STEVE
          Like you controlled the cube?

                          THOR
          You're work with the Tesseract is what
          drew Loki to it, and his allies. It is
          the signal to all the realms that the
          earth is ready for a higher form of
          war.

                          STEVE
          A higher form?

                          NICK FURY
          You forced our hand. We had to come up
          with something.

                          TONY
          Nuclear deterrent. `Cause that always
          calms everything right down.

                          NICK FURY
          Remind me again how you made your
          fortune, Stark?

                          STEVE TONY
          I'm sure if he still made Wait! Wait! Hold on! How is
          weapons, Stark would be neck this now about me?
          deep... I'm sorry, isn't THOR
          everything?
           I thought humans were more
           evolved than this.

                          NICK FURY
           Excuse me, did WE come to YOUR planet
           and blow stuff up?

                          THOR
           Did you always give your champions such
           mistrust?

                          NATASHA BANNER
          Are you all really that Captain America is on
          naive? S.H.I.E.L.D monitors potential threat potential
          threats? watch list?

                          TONY STEVE
           (to Steve) I swear to God, Stark, one
          You're on that list? Are you more crack...
          above or below angry bees?
          Threatening! I feel
          threatened!
          As the "team" argues, they don't realize the BLUE GEM on Loki's
          scepter is glowing brightly.

          INT. AIRCRAFT CARRIER Â­ DAY

          Outside the HELICARRIER, a lone carrier slowly hovers over the
          ship.

           SHIELD BASE VOICE
           661 Bravo, please relay your pass code.
           What is your hull, over?

                          BARTON
           Arms to ammunition, over.
          Inside, BARTON and his crew suit up and arm themselves. Barton
          pulls out his hi-tech bow and arrows.

          INT. BANNER'S LAB Â­ MORNING

          Back in the lab, the egos of these people keeping rubbing off
          each other and at any moment, the shit will hit the fan.

                          THOR
           You speak of control, yet you court
           chaos.

                          BANNER
           It's his M.O., isn't it? I mean, what
           are we, a team? No, no, no. We're a
           chemical mixture that makes chaos.
           We're... we're a time-bomb.

                          NICK FURY
           You need to step away.

                          TONY
           (puts his arm around Steve)
           Why shouldn't the guy let off a little
           steam?

                          STEVE
           (pushes Tony off)
           You know damn well why! Back off!

                          TONY
           (comes face-to-face with Cap)
           Oh, I'm starting to want you to make
           me.

                          STEVE
           Big man in a suit of armor. Take that
           off, what are you?

                          TONY
           Genius, billionaire, playboy,
           philanthropist.

                          STEVE
           I know guys with none of that worth ten
           of you. Yeah, I've seen the footage.

                          (MORE)

                          STEVE (CONT'D)
           The only thing you really fight for is
           yourself. You're not the guy to make
           the sacrifice play, to lay down on a
           wire and let the other guy crawl over
           you.

                          TONY
           I think I would just cut the wire.

                          STEVE

                          (SMILING)
           Always a way out... You know, you may
           not be a threat, but you better stop
           pretending to be a hero.

                          TONY
           (that did it)
           A hero? Like you? You're a lab rat,
           Rogers. Everything special about you
           came out of a bottle!

          OUTSIDE THE HELICARRIER
          The ramp of the carrier opens. The carrier maneuvers next to one
          of the large turbine engines. Barton stands at the base, holding
          out his bow. He pulls out a GRENADE TIPPED ARROW. He points
          right at the engine.
          Then...Barton moves his AIM and points the arrow about a hundred
          feet from the engine. He releases. The arrow flies out,but then
          SHARPLY heads for the engine. The arrow is punctured onto the
          engine. It has a visible timer which is COUNTING DOWN.

          INT. BANNER'S LAB Â­ MORNING

          Back in the lab, Steve puffs up his chest at Tony, who just
          stands there, unmoving.

                          STEVE
           Put on the suit, let's go a few rounds.
          Thor laughs at them.

                          THOR
           You people are so petty... and tiny.
          Tony rubs his head. Moves away from Cap.

                          BANNER
           Yeah, this is a tee...

                          NICK FURY
           Agent Romanoff, would you escort
           Dr.Banner back to his...

                          BANNER
           Where? You rented my room.

                          NICK FURY
           The cell was just in case...

                          BANNER
           In case you needed to kill me, but you
           can't! I know! I tried!

                          (A BEAT)
           I got low. I didn't see an end, so I
           put a bullet in my mouth and the other
           guy spit it out! So I moved on. I
           focused on helping other people. I was
           good, until you dragged me back into
           this freak show and put everyone here
           at risk!
          Banner slowly gets upset as he looks at Romanoff, who gets
          unnerved.

                          BANNER
           You wanna know my secret, Agent
           Romanoff? You wanna know how I stay
           calm?
          BLACK WIDOW and Fury have their hands down to grab their guns.

                          STEVE
           Doctor Banner... put down the scepter.

          BANNER LOOKS DOWN AND IS SHOCKED TO SEE HE'S HOLDING LOKI'S
          SCEPTER. The computer beeps. They all turn to it.

                          TONY
           Got it.
          Banner puts down the scepter and walks over to the computer.

                          BANNER
           Sorry, kids. You don't get to see my
           little party trick after all.

                          THOR
           Located the Tesseract?

                          TONY
           I can get there faster.

                          STEVE
           Look, all of us...

                          THOR
           The Tesseract belongs on Asgard, no
           human is a match for it.
          Tony turns to leave, but Steve stops him.

                          STEVE
           You're not going alone!

                          TONY
           You gonna stop me?

                          STEVE
           Put on the suit, let's find out.

                          TONY
           I'm not afraid to hit an old man.

                          STEVE
           Put on the suit.
          At that moment Banner who's looking at the monitor notices
          something about the Tesseract.

                          BANNER
           Oh, my God!

          OUTSIDE THE HELICARRIER
          Barton PULLS THE TRIGGER ON HIS BOW. The arrow then EXPLODES THE

          ENGINE RIGHT OFF THE HELICARRIER!

          INT. BANNER'S LAB Â­ MORNING

          Everyone is thrown in every direction. Steve, Fury, Thor and
          Tony are thrown across while Natasha and Banner is down in the
          lower equipment room. Steve looks up at Tony.

                          STEVE
           Put on the suit!

                          TONY
           Yep!
          Steve helps Tony up and out of the lab. Fury sits up, clutching
          his ribs. He puts on his EARPIECE.

          Natasha looks over to Banner, who is breathing heavy, having
          landed hard. He is gripping the grated floor to maintain
          control, but his eyes are green, his face intense.

                          NATASHA (CONT'D)

          Barton leads his men into the air ducts of the ship. They rappel

                          BARTON
           Get that engine down! Detention! Get
           him through the dark! Come with me.
          Two of his men follow him. They head towards the bridge.

           Find engine three. I'll meet you there.
          Cap peels off as Tony approaches a tech room. Inside, Tony's
          IRON MAN suit stands waiting, lit above in all its glory.

          ON BANNER'S FACE in the dim light as he struggles to suppress
          the rage, but his face is growing, changing slowly.
          Natasha is pulling herself painfully free, talking to Banner...

                          NATASHA
           Doctor... Bruce, you gotta fight it.
           This is just what Loki wants. We're
           gonna be okay. Listen to me.
          Two approaching SHIELD soldiers arrive to check on her. She
          furiously WAVES them away. They bolt out of there.

                          NATASHA
           We're gonna be okay. Right? I swear on
           my life I will get you out of this, you
           will walk away, and never...

                          BANNER
           Your life?
          His voice has the change in it -- the bitter amusement is
          morphing to a growled threat. Another explosion rocks the
          carrier -- and he turns to look at her, transforming just as the
          lights go out.

          Banner suddenly starts transforming into the HULK and gives
          Natasha one last knowing look. Natasha STRUGGLES FREE of the
          rubble. She stops.
          The HULK, sensing her, turns his head and puts on a face of a
          disturb monster. Natasha JOLTS up the stairs with the HULK
          chasing after her. Natasha maneuvers like a black widow should.
          She rolls under a turbine, starts to crawl within the maze of
          pipes. The HULK pulls them out from above the catwalk.
          Natasha falls through under the catwalks and quickly and
          stealthily escapes. The HULK lets out a ROAR OF RAGE unlike
          anything. PRIMAL. Not human.

           Why water? Navigations recalibrated
           after the engine failure.

                          NICK FURY
           Is the sun coming up?!

                          HELMSMAN
           Yes, sir.

                          NICK FURY
           Then put it on the left! Get us over
           water! One more turbine goes down and
           we drop.

          EXT. HELICARRIER PORT SIDE Â­ DAY

          CAPTAIN AMERICA, pushing with all his strength the door to
          portside, sees SHIELD tech in full oxygen masks shoot fire
          extinguishers and cover from sparks -- largely unable to do
          anything.
          Engine 3 is totally dead. A LARGE CHUNK of the port side in TORN

          OFF.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Stark, I'm here!

                          TONY
           Good. See what we got.
          Tony flies in his IRON MAN suit and gets close to the damaged
          engine.

          INSIDE THE SUIT
          Tony observes within his viewscreen at the damaged engine and
          its layouts.

                          TONY
           I gotta get this super conducting
           cooling system back online before I can
           access the rotors and work on
           dislodging the debris.

          EXT. HELICARRIER PORT SIDE Â­ DAY

          IRON MAN begins PULLING on the stuck rotors. Looks over atSteve.

                          IRON MAN
           I need you to get to that engine
           control panel and tell me which relays
           are in overload position.
          IRON MAN flies into giant cooling conductors. CAPTAIN AMERICA
          JUMPS over to the other side of the broken railing. CAPTAIN
          AMERICA gets himself to the control panel and opens it up. For a
          man who grew up as a YANK, what the fuck is this!

                          IRON MAN
           What's it look like in there?

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           It seems to run on some form of
           electricity.

                          IRON MAN
           Well, you're not wrong.

          INT. LOWER EQUIPMENT ROOM, CARRIER Â­ DAY

          Natasha continuously crawls under the catwalk. She stops.
          Then...BOOM. BOOM. BOOM. The room vibrates. Rhythmically.
          Natasha pulls out her gun and slowly walks out onto the catwalk
          and spins.
          ...and then a ROAR. THE HULK. Natasha FIRES a shot into a liquid
          nitrogen pipe that hits the hulk in face. The HULK SMASHES THE
          SHIT OUT OF IT. Natasha begins to run through the maze of
          corridors. The sound the monster is coming.
          Finally, she reaches and a long corridor. As she runs, behind
          her, the HULK TEARS up the hallway, coming at her.
          Natasha turns to see, but the HULK SLAPS her into the wall,

          SMASHING INTO THE GROUND.
          The HULK marks his territory. Natasha looks up. A fear she has
          never felt begins to seep out. The HULK raises his hand and IS
          KNOCKED OFF HIS FEET BY THOR WHO TACKLES HIM INTO the next room.

          INT. HELICARRIER AIRCRAFT PORT Â­ CONTINUOUS

          Both Thor and HULK roll across the floor. Every person runs the
          hell out. Thor looks up at this magnificent beast. The HULK
          stands up and moving like a boxer, wants Thor to make his move.
          The HULK makes his move.
          SWING AND A MISS. Thor swings his massive hand and almost knocks
          HULK off his feet. HULK keeps swinging and missing, pissing him
          off. Finally, he brings down his arm, but Thor grabs it and
          wraps around it.

                          THOR
           We are not your enemies, Banner! Try to
           think!
          HULK lifts his arm up, to Thor's surprise, and he SENDS HIM

          FLYING AS HE PUNCHES THOR'S FACE WITH HIS FIST.

          EXT. HELICARRIER PORT SIDE Â­ DAY

          IRON MAN continuously BLASTS broken debris off the turbine
          engine. It's bad, but still fixable.

           CAPTAIN AMERICA (V.O.)
           The relays are intact. What's our next
           move?

                          TONY
           Even if I clear the rotors, this thing
           won't re-engage without a jump. I'm
           gonna have to get in there and push.

          EXT. HELICARRIER PORT SIDE Â­ DAY


                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Well if that thing gets up to speed,
           you'll get shredded!

                          TONY
           Then stay in the control unit and
           reverse polarity long enough to
           disengage mag...

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Speak English!

                          TONY
           See that red lever? It'll slow the
           rotors down long enough for me to get
           out. Stand by it, wait for my word.
          CAPTAIN AMERICA looks over at the other side where he was. He
          sees the red lever and JUMPS towards it.

          INT. HELICARRIER AIRCRAFT PORT Â­ DAY

          Thor CRASHES into another stack of crates. As he raises his
          head, he feels something on his lips. BLOOD. As he swipes it
          off, the ROAR of the HULK is not too far. Thor extends his hand
          out.
          The ROAR gets LOUDER and CLOSER. Thor focuses. His hand strains
          toward mid-air. His eyes tight in concentration. The HULK runs
          right at him. At the last second, MJÃ–LNIR flies into his hand
          and Thor UPPERCUTS HULK, WHO CRASHES INTO A FIGHTER JET.
          HULK stands up, shaking his head like `what the fuck just
          happened.' He SHAKES it off and ANGRILY rips off the TAIL of the
          jet, TORQUES HIS BODY LIKE A GREEK DISCUS THROWER AND... HURLS

          THE MASSIVE PLATE AT THOR.
          Thor SLIDES and DUCKS under the tail. Jumping up, he throws
          MjÃ¶lnir with all his strength, knocking the HULK head over
          heels. HULK falls down, hammer in hand. HE tries to lift it, but
          can't. MjÃ¶lnir rests atop his hand.
          Struggle as he may, HULK wraps his hand around the hammer. The
          hammer doesn't move. To no avail -- he strains with all his
          might, SCREAMS from the effort, BELLOWING.
          Thor jumps up again, KNEEING HULK in the face. Thor grabs his
          hammer, jumps on him, using the hammer as a lock for his
          CHOKEHOLD. Hulk tries to pull him off.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE Â­ DAY

          Fury and Agent Hill look over their monitors.

                          NICK FURY
           We need a full evac on the lower hangar
           bay.
          Agent Hill nods. She leaves to exit out, but a SLIDING GRENADE
          appears.

           AGENT MARIA HILL

           GRENADE!
          The grenade goes off, sending her down the steps. Fury FIRES a
          shot at the open entrance. He moves over behind the side of the
          entrance. A handful of Barton's men enter. Watchful, ready,
          waiting... Fury steps out, his GUN drawn.
          A SHOOT OUT and HAND-TO-HAND ensues, but Fury is unable to stop
          one of them, which is why he is shot in the head by Agent Hill,
          who looks hot and sexy holding her gun.

          INT. HELICARRIER ARMORY SECTION Â­ DAY

          Agent Coulson walks up the armory door. He places his head into
          a FACIAL RECOGNITION SCANNER. Walks into the room.

           AGENT JASPER SITWELL (V.O.)
           We got perimeter breach! Hostiles are
           in SHIELD gear. Hold on to every

          INT. HELICARRIER AIRCRAFT PORT Â­ DAY

          HULK CRASHES from under the floor, sending Thor on his ass. HULK
          grabs him by the neck.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE Â­ DAY

          A gunfight opens up. AGENTS exchange fire with brutally
          efficient tactical soldiers.

           AGENT JASPER SITWELL (V.O.)
           Sir, the HULK and Thor are in shuttle
           levels 2, 3 and 4!

           AGENT MARIA HILL
           Sir, the Hulk will tear this place
           apart!

                          NICK FURY
           Get his attention.

          ESCORT 606 PILOT slowly makes his way in. sees the action going

           (pulls the trigger; fires
           guns at HULK)
          A SHOWER OF BULLETS SPRAYS THE HULK EVERYWHERE. Thor ducks for
          cover. The HULK turns around, letting out his PRIMAL ROAR. He
          jumps up, TAKES A RUNNING START AND LEAPS...

          ESCORT 606 PILOT LOOKS LIKE HE TOOK A SHIT.

                          ESCORT 606 PILOT

           TARGET ANGRY! TARGET ANGRY!
          HULK LANDS ON THE JET'S NOSE. THE JET SPINS WILDLY. As the HULK
          tears it apart, ESCORT 606 PILOT pulls his ejection seat, but

          HOLD THE FUCKIN' DOOR!

          THE HULK CATCHES HIM, WAVES HIM AROUND AND THEN THROWS HIM AWAY.
          ESCORT 606 PILOT pulls his parachute. THE JET EXPLODES. THE HULK

          PLUMMETS TO EARTH, ROARING HIS SWAN SONG.

          EXT. HELICARRIER PORT SIDE Â­ DAY

          IRON MAN laser cuts a big piece of broken metal. He then JUMPS
          on it, relieving the rotors.
          On the other side, BARTON'S men enter the port side. CAPTAIN
          AMERICA looks down, pondering if they are help. Evidently not as
          they begin SHOOTING at him and throwing grenades.
          CAPTAIN AMERICA jumps to the other railing and down with
          Barton's men. He begins to TAKE THEM DOWN, even goes as far as
          throwing one off. A few more enter, FIRING.
          CAPTAIN AMERICA grabs a NOVESKE RIFLEWORKS DIPLOMAT (big word
          for big fuckin' gun) and jumps back up to his position, firing
          down at them.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE Â­ DAY

          The gunfight has gone down, but more of Barton's men enter and
          are taken by Fury, who is confused as to why they keep coming.

                          NICK FURY
           They are not getting through here, so
           what the hell...
          Suddenly, Barton LOOSES an arrow down to the bridge and EXPLODES
          critical spots. Barton releases a multi-tipped arrow towards
          Fury, but instead hits his command desk, right above a USB

          OUTLETS.
          Fury FIRES at Barton, but is already gone. The arrow then self-
          activates and inserts itself into the outlets, hacking every
          single monitor and main frame. The hacking causes Engine 1 to
          shut off. Suddenly, the HELICARRIER begins to DANGEROUSLY TILT
          to one side.

           AGENT JASPER SITWELL (O.S.)
           Sir, we've lost all power in Engine 1.

                          NICK FURY
           It's Barton. He took out our systems.
           He's headed for the detention level.
           Does anybody copy?

          INT. LOWER EQUIPMENT ROOM, CARRIER- DAY

          Still shaken by the HULK ordeal, Natasha sits there, rocking
          back and forth, after crying for a while. Summoning back all her
          coolness, she touches her EARPIECE.

                          NATASHA
           This is Agent Romanoff. I copy.
          Natasha SPRINGS up and runs for Barton.

          EXT. HELICARRIER PORT SIDE Â­ DAY

          IRON MAN begins to push the rotor using BOOSTERS from his boots.

           NICK FURY (V.O.)
           Stark, we're losing altitude.

                          IRON MAN
           Yeah. Noticed.
          The rotors start propelling faster and faster as IRON MAN'S
          BOOSTERS get more and more bright.
          On the other side, CAPTAIN AMERICA continuously shoots at
          Barton's men. Blinking at the wrong moment, CAPTAIN AMERICA
          loses the upper hand and SLIDES off the railing, but grabs onto
          a LOOSE CABLE.

          Thor runs into the detention section where he finds Loki,

                          THOR

           NO!
          Thor CHARGES at his brother. Loki walks up to him and CROUCHES
          down to attack. THOR ONLY GOES THROUGH HIM. The false Loki
          dissipates into nothingness. THE REAL LOKI comes out from behind
          the cell door, which closes on THOR, locking him up. Loki
          smiles.

                          LOKI

          Barton walks alone down the catwalk. In a lightning fast move,
          Barton nocks an arrow, and points it at NATASHA. A hand-to-hand
          fight ensues. Natasha CRAWLS her way around Barton, making
          Barton to drop his bow, but pulls out a KNIFE on her.

          INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION Â­ DAY

          Thor, in a fit of anger, SLAMS MJÃ–LNIR onto the glass cell. To
          his surprise, the cell door only CRACKS, but violently SHAKES
          the ship. Loki stands there in caution, as does his GUARDING

          SOLDIER.

           The humans think us immortal. Should we
           test that?
          Suddenly, GUARDING SOLDIER falls down like a tree. AGENT COULSON
          stands there, holding PHASE 2 WEAPON PROTOTYPE.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           Move away, please.
          Loki moves away from the switch.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           You like this? We started working on
           the prototype after you sent THE
           DESTROYER. Even I don't know what it
           does. Do you wanna find out?

          A LOUD GASP. AGENT COULSON IS IMPALED THROUGH THE HEART. THE

          REAL LOKI STANDS BEHIND COULSON.

                          THOR
           Nooo!
          Loki sends Agent Coulson against the wall. Agent Coulson slumps
          down, breathing fast. Loki makes his way to the control switch.
          He gives his brother one last look. Thor looks at him, hopeful.
          Loki opens the HATCH. Thor still hopes. LOKI HITS THE BUTTON AND

          DROPS THOR OUT OF THE SHIP.

          INT. LOWER EQUIPMENT ROOM, CARRIER Â­ DAY

          Barton and Natasha continue attacking each other. Natasha
          KICKBOXES Barton's face. Feeling that, Barton takes a SWING at
          her, but she grabs his arm, TWISTING it. BARTON WRITHES IN PAIN.
          Using his other arm, he tosses the knife over and begins to
          SLASH at Natasha. She dodges every move, but finds herself in a
          LOCK HOLD with him. As he forces the knife down, she BITES his
          wrist. Barton lets go of the knife.
          Natasha WRAPS her legs around his neck, FLIPS him over and arm
          LOCKS him. She SLAMS his head into a pipes rail. Barton goes
          down, hard. He looks up her, almost coming to his real senses.

                          BARTON
           Natasha...
          Natasha COLDCOCKS him. Barton is out.

          Thor, trapped in the glass cage, BOUNCES off the JUMBLING cell
          pod. As it draws closer to land, Thor tries to swing at glass,
          but misses. Land draws closer.
          In a final attempt before crashing, Thor positions himself onto
          the glass door and LEAPFROGS just as the cage is about to hit
          the ground. The cell CRASHES into the shore as Thor crashes out
          into the meadow.

          INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION Â­ DAY

          Loki has no remorse as he looks down. He closes the hatch and
          proceeds to leave. A WEAK VOICE.

           You're gonna lose.

           It's in your nature.

           Your heroes are scattered, your
           floating fortress falls from the

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           You lack conviction.

           I don't think I...

          AGENT COULSON SHOOTS LOKI WITH HIS PHASE 2 WEAPON PROTOTYPE,

          CAUSING LOKI TO BE BLOWN THROUGH THE WALL BEHIND HIM.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           So that's what it does.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE Â­ DAY

          Back in the bridge, Fury sees on his VIEWSCREEN that the hatch
          has been open. Knowing Agent Coulson was sent there, he goes to.

          EXT. HELICARRIER PORT SIDE Â­ DAY

          IRON MAN continuously SPINS Engine 3, giving it all he has. THE
          ROTORS ARE PROPELLING PROPERLY AND FAST. The HELICARRIER LEVELS
          itself.

          INSIDE THE SUIT

                          TONY
           Cap, I need the lever!

           STEVE (V.O.)
           I need a minute here!

                          TONY
           Lever. Now!
          Tony lets go of the rotors. They spin by themselves. Tony is
          then caught in one. He is now fucked. IRON MAN slips into the
          rotors, getting chewed up.

          EXT. HELICARRIER PORT SIDE Â­ DAY

          CAPTAIN AMERICA CLIMBS up the loose cable and reaches the
          railing.
          BARTON'S MAN opens fire once more. CAPTAIN AMERICA pulls himself
          up and finally PULLS the lever.
          A VENT opens up from Engine 3. IRON MAN falls out, but the suit
          heavily damaged, hardly keeping him up. IRON MAN heads for Cap.
          BARTON'S MAN turns his AIM to IRON MAN, who TACKLES him into the
          wall. IRON MAN rolls over, tired. Cap lets out a sigh of relief.

          OUTSIDE THE HELICARRIER
          The carrier that brought Barton and his team now leaves, taking
          Loki and his scepter. The carrier flies into the distance.

          INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION Â­ DAY

          Fury runs in finding Agent Coulson still alive, barely.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           Sorry, boss. They got rabbited.

                          NICK FURY
           Just stay awake. EYES ON ME!

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           No. I'm clocked out here.

                          NICK FURY
           Not an option.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           It's okay, boss. This was never going
           to work... if they didn't have
           something... to...
          Agent Coulson looks away. Sighs his last breath. Nick Fury looks
          on grimly at Coulson. The medical team arrives.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE Â­ DAY


           NICK FURY (V.O.)
           Agent Coulson is down.
          Agent Hill is being treated for a gash on her head, listens on
          her headset, standing up.

           SHIELD AGENT (V.O.)
           Paramedics are on their way.

           NICK FURY (V.O.)
           They're here.

          INT. HELICARRIER PORT SIDE Â­ DAY

          Steve and Tony listen in as well.

           NICK FURY (V.O.)
           They called it.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE Â­ LATER

          Fury gathers Tony and Steve back into the briefing room everyone
          there has a look as if in a daze. A look of numb shock is shown
          on their devastated faces.

                          NICK FURY
           These were in Phil Coulson's jacket.
           Guess he never did get you to sign
           them.
          Fury throws Coulson's CAPTAIN AMERICA TRADING CARDS on the table
          towards Steve. Steve picks them up, STAINED WITH BLOOD.

                          NICK FURY
           We're dead in the air up here. Our
           communications, location of the cube,
           Banner, Thor. I got nothing for you.
           Lost my one good eye. Maybe I had that
           coming.

                          (A BEAT)
           Yes, we were going to build an arsenal
           with the Tesseract. I never put all my
           chips on that number though, because I
           was playing something even riskier.
           There was an idea, Stark knows this,
           called THE AVENGERS INITIATIVE. The
           idea was to bring together a group of
           remarkable people, see if they could
           become something more. See if they
           could work together when we needed them
           to, to fight the battles that we never
           could. Phil Coulson died still
           believing in that idea, in heroes.
          Tony gets up and walks off, not wanting to hear it anymore.

                          NICK FURY
           Well, it's an old fashioned notion.

          EXT. MEADOW Â­ DAY

          Thor walks out far into the meadow. He looks down. MJÃ–LNIR.

          INT. ABANDONED BUILDING Â­ DAY

          Banner wakes up, in human form. He looks around and sees he is
          IN A PILE OF RUBBLE and looks up at the OPEN CEILING HE CRASHED
          IN. AND IS COMPLETELY NAKED. A SECURITY GUARD stands there,
          amazed.

                          SECURITY GUARD
           You fell out of the sky.

                          BANNER

                          (COMING TO)
           Did I hurt anybody?

                          SECURITY GUARD
           There's nobody around here to get hurt.
           You did scare the hell out of some
           pigeons though.

                          BANNER
           Lucky.

                          SECURITY GUARD
           Or just good aim. You were awake when
           you fell.

                          BANNER
           You saw?

                          SECURITY GUARD
           The whole thing, right through the
           ceiling. Big and green and buck ass
           nude. Here...
          He throws Banner a pair of big pants. Banner pulls on his pants.

                          SECURITY GUARD
           I didn't think those would fit you
           until you shrunk down to a regular size
           fella.

                          BANNER
           Thank you.
          A beat.

                          SECURITY GUARD
           Are you an alien?

                          BANNER
           What?

                          SECURITY GUARD
           From outer space, an alien?

                          BANNER
           No.

                          SECURITY GUARD
           Well then, son, you've got a condition.

          INT. HELICARRIER MEDICAL ROOM Â­ DAY

          Barton is strapped down. Natasha watches over him as Barton
          tries to shake off Loki's mind control.

                          NATASHA
           Clint, you're gonna be alright.

                          CLINT BARTON
           You know that? Is that what you know? I
           got...I gotta go in though. I gotta
           flush him out.

                          NATASHA
           We don't have that long, it's gonna
           take time.

                          CLINT BARTON
           I don't understand. Have you ever had
           someone take your brain and play? Pull
           you out and send something else in? Do
           you know what it's like to be unmade?

                          NATASHA
          You know that I do.

                          CLINT BARTON
          Why am I back? How did you get him out?

                          NATASHA
          Cognitive recalibration. I hit you
          really hard in the head.

                          CLINT BARTON
          Thanks.
           (Natasha unfastens the

                          RESTRAINTS)
          Tasha, how many agents?

                          NATASHA
          Don't. Don't do that to yourself,
          Clint. This is Loki. This is monsters
          and magic and nothing we were ever
          trained for.

                          CLINT BARTON
          Loki, he got away?

                          NATASHA
          Yeah. I don't suppose you know where?

                          CLINT BARTON
          I didn't need to know. I didn't ask.
          He's gonna make his play soon though.
          Today.

                          NATASHA
          We gotta stop him.

                          CLINT BARTON
          Yeah? Who's we?

                          NATASHA
          I don't know. Whoever's left.

                          CLINT BARTON
          Well, if I put an arrow in Loki's
          eyesocket, I'd sleep better I suppose.

                          NATASHA
          Now you sound like you.
          Natasha sits next to her partner and friend.

                          CLINT BARTON
           But you don't. You're a spy, not a
           soldier. Now you want to wade into a
           war. Why? What did Loki do to you?

                          NATASHA
           He didn't, I just...

           Natasha.

                          NATASHA
           I've been compromised. I got red in my
           ledger. I'd like to wipe it out.

          INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION Â­ DAY

          Tony look at the empty cell container. He stands not saying a
          word. Steve walks in.

                          STEVE
           Was he married?

                          TONY
           No. There was a uh...cellist, I think.

                          STEVE
           I'm sorry. He seemed like a good man.

                          TONY
           He was an idiot.

                          STEVE
           Why? For believing?

                          TONY
           For taking on Loki alone.

                          STEVE
           He was doing his job.

                          TONY
           He was out of his league. He should
           have waited. He should have...

                          STEVE
          Sometimes there isn't a way out, Tony.

                          TONY

                          (WALKS AWAY)
          Right. How did that work for him?

                          STEVE
          Is this the first time you've lost a
          soldier?

                          TONY
           (turns around sharply)
          WE ARE NOT SOLDIERS! I am not marching
          to Fury's fife!

                          STEVE
          Neither am I! He's got the same blood
          on his hands as Loki does. Right now
          we've got to put that aside and get
          this done. Now Loki needs a power
          source, if we can put together a
          list...

                          TONY
           (looking at the blood stained

                          WALL)
          He made it personal.

                          STEVE
          That's not the point.

                          TONY
          That is the point. That's Loki's point.
          He hit us all right where we live. Why?

                          STEVE
          To tear us apart.

                          TONY
          He had to conquer his greed, but he
          knows he has to take us out to win,
          right? That's what he wants. He wants
          to beat us and he wants to be seen
          doing it. He wants an audience.

                          STEVE
           Right, I caught his act at Stuttengard.

                          TONY
           Yeah. That's just a preview, this is
           opening night. Loki's a full-tilt diva.
           He wants flowers, he wants parades, he
           wants a monument built in the skies
           with his name plastered...

          backwards. DOWN BELOW, CITIZENS OF NEW YORK look up at STARK
          TOWER. IRON MAN stares in disbelief at the CMS ... unharmed.

                          JARVIS
           The barrier is pure energy. It's
           unbreachable. The Mark VII is not ready
           to be deployed.

                          TONY
           Skip the spinning rims. We're on the
           clock.
          TONY lands his SUIT and goes through the gauntlet and unsuits
          him. LOKI looks up at him, smiling. They proceed to walk into
          the penthouse.

          INT. STARK PENTHOUSE Â­ DAY

          Loki walks in, holding the scepter. Tony casually walks down the
          steps, towards the bar.

                          LOKI
           Please tell me you're going to appeal
           to my humanity.

                          TONY
           Uh...actually, I'm planning to threaten
           you.

                          LOKI
           You should have left your armor on for
           that.

                          TONY
           Yeah, it's seen a bit of mileage.
           You've got the blue stick of destiny.
           Would you like a drink?

                          LOKI
           Stalling me won't change anything.

                          TONY
           No, no, no! Threatening. No drink? You
           sure? I'm having one.

                          LOKI
           The CHITAURI are coming, nothing will
           change that. What have I to fear?

                          TONY

           THE AVENGERS.
           (Loki looks at him, confused)
           It's what we call ourselves, sort of
           like a team. `EARTH'S MIGHTIEST HEROES'
           type of thing.

                          LOKI
           Yes, I've met them.

                          TONY

                          (SMILING)
           Yeah, takes us a while to get any
           traction, I'll give you that one.

                          TONY (CONT'D)
           But, let's do a head count here. Your
           brother, the demi-God; a super soldier,
           a living legend who kind of lives up to
           the legend; a man with breath-taking
           anger management issues; a couple of
           master assassins, and you, big fella,
           you've managed to piss off every single
           one of them.

                          LOKI
           That was the plan.

                          TONY
           Not a great plan. When they come, and
           they will, they'll come for you.
          From underneath the bar table, Tony pulls on COLANTOTTE
          BRACELETS, a honing device.

                          LOKI
           I have an army.

                          TONY
           We have a HULK.

                          LOKI
           I thought the beast had wandered off.

                          TONY
           You're missing the point. There's no
           throne, there is no version of this,
           where you come out on top. Maybe your
           army comes and maybe it's too much for
           us, but it's all on you. Because if we
           can't protect the Earth, you can be
           damned well sure we'll avenge it.

                          LOKI
           (slowly walks up to him;
           raising the scepter)
           How will your friends have time for
           me,when they're so busy fighting you?
          Loki TAPS Tony on the chest with his scepter. PING! Nothing.
          Confused, Loki tires again. PING! NOTHING.

                          LOKI
           It should work.

                          TONY
           Well, performance issues. You know?
          In anger, Loki GRABS Tony by the throat and FLINGS him across
          the room.

                          TONY
           Jarvis. Anytime now.
          Loki grabs Tony by the throat again.

                          LOKI
           You will all fall before me.
          LOKI THROWS TONY OUT THE WINDOW. Tony FREEFALLS down the tower.
          From behind Loki, an elevator opens and a RED POD SHOOTS out.
          The pod LASER SIGNALS the COLANTOTTE BRACELETS on Tony. The POD
          begins to TRANSFORM into the MARK VII suit.
          It LATCHES onto Tony. IRON MAN. The suit FLIES up before he hits
          the ground or the gazing people. Loki looks up, angry.

                          IRON MAN
           And there's one other person you pissed
           off! His name was Phil.
          Loki raises the scepter. IRON MAN FIRES at Loki, sending him on
          his ass.

          EXT. STARK TOWER Â­ DAY

          Selvig looks up at the sky. The Tesseract's energy BEAMS into
          the sky. The beam then forms a VORTEX, which then opens up

          ANOTHER PORTAL.

          EXT. VASTNESS OF SPACE

          A hole in space rips open, and from it, the CHITAURI ARMY SPILLS
          out in FLYING CHARIOTS, carrying ENERGY RIFLES with a bayonet on
          the end.

          INSIDE THE SUIT

                          TONY
           Right. Army.
          IRON MAN flies up towards the portal. From his shoulders, a
          miniature multiple rocket launcher, pops out and FIRES. Like the
          JERICHO MISSILE, several targets are taken down unlike no
          missile. It's useless. THOUSANDS OF CHITAURI FLY OUT. IRON MAN
          flies towards the city.

          EXT. MANHATTAN Â­ DAY

          The CHITAURI UNLEASH. New Yorkers fill the streets, staring at
          the fire fight in the distance. BOOM!!! The CHITAURI unleashes
          BLASTS as it goes, blowing up cars, setting storefronts aflame.

          AN EXPLOSION RIPS OUT THE WINDOWS OF THE TOP CORNER OF

          BUILDINGS. FLAME AND STONE RAIN DOWN. A DOMINO-EFFECT OF

          EXPLOSIONS RIPPLING ACROSS THE BRIDGE.

          EXT. STARK TOWER Â­ DAY

          Loki walks onto the balcony as the SOUNDS of the CHITAURI rings
          out. He admires his soon to be kingdom. THOR LANDS ON THE TOWER.
          Loki turns to his ENEMY.

                          THOR
           Loki! Turn off the Tesseract or I'll
           destroy it!

                          LOKI
           You can't. There is no stopping it.
           There is only the war!

                          THOR
           So be it.
          Loki and Thor rush at each other. They and their weapons
          collide. The two battle -- Loki unleashing another pent-up rage
          and jealousy, Thor having no choice but to defend himself.

          EXT. MANHATTAN Â­ DAY

          SOLDIERS AND COPS have taken positions covering the streets.
          They see from the sky, IRON MAN leading a trail of CHITAURI
          towards his tower.

          EXT. SKY Â­ DAY

          The QUINJET BOOMS into the city.

           BLACK WIDOW (V.O.)
           Stark, we're heading north east.

          INSIDE THE SUIT

                          IRON MAN
           What, did you stop for drive-thru?
           Swing up PARK, I'm gonna lay 'em out
           for you.

          EXT. STARK TOWER Â­ DAY

          IRON MAN BANKS around his tower. Sees Thor and Loki still going
          at it. IRON MAN SWOOPS down the street, causing a CHITAURI to
          crash.
          Flying up, IRON MAN puts the following CHITAURI in view of the
          QUINJET. BLACK WIDOW takes out machine gun and FIRES at the

          CHITAURI.

          INSIDE THE SUIT

                          JARVIS
           Sir, we have more incoming.

                          TONY
           Fine. Let's keep them occupied.
          IRON MAN heads back to the portal.

          EXT. STARK TOWER Â­ DAY

          Thor and Loki battle savagely. Loki fires ENERGY from the
          scepter, sending Thor sliding across the floor.

          INT. QUINJET Â­ DAY

          HAWKEYE looks out to his left window, finding a target.

                          HAWKEYE
           Yeah.

                          BLACK WIDOW
           See them.
          HAWKEYE BANKS the jet towards STARK TOWER. Aims the MINIGUN at
          Loki. Loki AIMS the scepter at the QUINJET and FIRES A BLAST OF
          ENERGY. Thor gets to his feet, TACKLING Loki down hard.
          THE QUINJET is soon caught on fire. HAWKEYE maneuvers one wing
          of the jet. They SPIN and SLOW. DROPPING OUT OF THE AIR AS IT
          PASSES OVER SKYSCRAPERS. Then... they SLAM into the street.

          INT. QUINJET Â­ DAY

          With everyone okay, HAWKEYE and BLACK WIDOW unfasten their
          seatbelts and open the ramp. CAPTAIN AMERICA runs down, followed
          by HAWKEYE and BLACK WIDOW. Each one has their respected weapons
          in hand.

          EXT. FOUR WAY STREET Â­ DAY

          The TRIO arrives in the middle of a four-way street. Suddenly,
          the city LURCHES to a stop. A DEEP, PRIMAL RAGE BELLOWS OUT.
          With that roar, a SHADOW comes over them.

          EXT. VASTNESS OF SPACE

          From the portal, a FUCKING CHITAURI LEVIATHAN FLIES OUT!
          Carrying hundreds of SOLDIERS, the CHITAURI LEVIATHAN PASSES
          OVER the TRIO.

          EXT. BRIDGE STREET Â­ DAY

          They look up, out of their element. From both sides, CHITAURI
          SOLDIERS CLING OFF and attach themselves to the sides of the
          buildings, sliding down. Some CRASH into these buildings and
          begin FIRING from their ENERGY RIFLES at innocent people.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Stark, are you seeing this?

          INSIDE THE SUIT

                          TONY
           I'm seeing, still working on believing.
           Where's Banner? Has he shown up yet?

           CAPTAIN AMERICA (V.O.)
           Banner?

                          TONY
           Just keep me posted. Jarvis, find me a
           soft spot.
          IRON MAN quietly flies behind and parallel with the CHITAURI

          LEVIATHAN.

          EXT. STARK TOWER Â­ DAY

          Thor holds down Loki's face straight ahead, forcing him to watch
          the city falling to ash.

                          THOR
           Look at this! Look around you! You
           think this madness will end with your
           rule?

                          LOKI
           (tries to look away)
           It's too late. It's too late to stopit.

                          THOR
           No. We can. Together.
          Loki looks at his brother, showing a sign of hope. Then... Loki
          stabs Thor with a small knife. Thor keels over.

                          LOKI
           Sentiment.
          Thor gets up, KICKS Loki and lifts him into the air. Thor then
          SLAMS him down, hard. Loki, bleeding, rolls over the edge. Thor
          looks down. LOKI IS RIDING ON A FLYING CHARIOT. DOZENS of
          CHITAURI follow his lead.

          EXT. BRIDGE STREET Â­ DAY

          The TRIO runs behind upside taxis. They look up and see Loki
          taking his band down the street and FIRES at the street IN A

          CHAIN OF EXPLOSIONS. SMASHING CARS AND HURLING PEOPLE AS IT GOES

          IT GOES OFF IN ONE FINAL CONFLAGRATION.
          TERRIFIED PEOPLE running from Loki, looking over their
          shoulders, coming straight at us. CAPTAIN AMERICA looks down the
          bridge.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Those people need assistance down
           there.
          CHITAURI SOLDIERS that have landed near them and begin FIRING at
          them. BLACK WIDOW pulls both pistols and FIRES. Turns to Cap.

                          BLACK WIDOW
           We got this. It's good. Go!

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA

                          (AT HAWKEYE)
           You think you can hold them off?

                          HAWKEYE
           Captain.
           (pulls a trigger on his bow;
           a narrow is mechanically

                          CHOSEN)
           It would be my genuine pleasure.
          HAWKEYE shoots an ARROW into the creature's head, gaining a few
          seconds for CAPTAIN AMERICA as he falls down the bridge,
          followed by an EXPLOSION.
          Cap races over to the plaza, jumping over dozens of EXPLODING
          cars. THE FIRST AVENGER RUNS LIKE A FUCKING CHEETAH.
          HAWKEYE runs over a bus full of people. From the windows, SMALL
          CHILDREN are held by their parents for HAWKEYE to pull them out
          to safety. He runs over to the jammed door and JERKILY opens it.
          People begin to run out.
          BLACK WIDOW empties out her CLIPS. HAWKEYE fires ARROWS into the
          ranks of the CHITAURI, hitting his mark each time he shoots.

                          BLACK WIDOW
           Just like BUDAPEST all over again!

                          HAWKEYE
           You and I remember Budapest
           verydifferently.

          EXT. MANHATTAN Â­ DAY

          The COPS continuously fire at the flying chariots. It's pretty
          pointless. A YOUNG COP runs over to his POLICE SERGEANT.

                          YOUNG COP
           We need to get out! They gotta bring
           the National Guard!

                          POLICE SERGEANT
           National Guard? Does the army know
           what's happening here?

                          YOUNG COP
           Do we?
          CAPTAIN AMERICA jumps in front of them. They look up at this
          ridiculous looking man.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           I need men in these buildings. There
           are people inside that can run into the
           line of fire. You take them through the
           basement or through the subway. You
           keep them off the streets. I need a
           perimeter as far back as 39th.

                          POLICE SERGEANT
           Why the hell should I take orders from
           you?
          Suddenly, an EXPLOSION comes up from behind Cap. An ENERGY BLAST
          is blocked by his SHIELD. TWO CHITAURI SOLDIERS attack. The cops
          watch in shock as CAPTAIN AMERICA FIGHTS them off with ease. The
          Sergeant turns to his officer.

                          POLICE SERGEANT
           I need men in those buildings, lead the
           people down and away from the streets.
           I need a perimeter as far back as 39th.

          EXT. SKY LINE Â­ DAY

          IRON MAN swerves around a building and faces the CHITAURI
          LEVIATHAN. He pulls out his miniature multiple rocket launcher
          and FIRES. The CHITAURI LEVIATHAN ROARS in annoyance. The
          CHITAURI LEVIATHAN turns to him.

                          IRON MAN

                          (TO JARVIS)
           We got his attention. What the hell is
           step two?!
          IRON MAN flies away.

          EXT. BRIDGE STREET Â­ DAY

          HAWKEYE TRIPS a CHITAURI SOLDIER and RAMS an arrow down its
          throat. BLACK WIDOW gets her hands on an ENERGY RIFLE and
          STICKFIGHTS the hell out of them.
          CAPTAIN AMERICA joins back in and using his SHIELD, SWAPS and
          WHACKS oncoming CHITAURI SOLDIERS. It's all too much on them,
          until...
          Lightning strikes down from the sky, channeling the blast,
          firing the electricity out at the CHITAURI SOLDIERS around them.
          They're blasted back in a massive shockwave. The CHITAURI
          SOLDIERS convulse, drop dead to the ground. THOR TOUCHES DOWN.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           What's the story upstairs?

                          THOR
           The powers surrounding the cube is
           impenetrable.

           IRON MAN (V.O.)
           Thor is right. We gotta deal with these
           guys.

                          BLACK WIDOW
           How do we do this?

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           As a team.

                          THOR
           I have unfinished business with Loki.

                          HAWKEYE
           Yeah, get in line.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Save it. Loki's gonna keep this fight
           focused on us and that's what we need.
           Without him these things could run
           wild. We got Stark up top, he's gonna
           need us...
          Just then, BANNER ARRIVES ON A SMALL MOTORBIKE. Getting off, he
          looks around the city.

                          BANNER
           So, this all seems horrible.

                          BLACK WIDOW
           I've seen worse.

                          BANNER
           Sorry.

                          BLACK WIDOW
           No. We could use a little worse.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Stark? We got him.

           IRON MAN (V.O.)
           Banner?

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Just like you said.

          INSIDE THE SUIT

                          TONY
           Then tell him to suit up. I'm bringing
           the party to you.
          IRON MAN comes out from behind a building. The CHITAURI
          LEVIATHAN follows, impatiently.

          EXT. BRIDGE STREET Â­ DAY

          The rest of the AVENGERS look up, getting ready and standing
          still.

                          BLACK WIDOW
           I... I don't see how that's a party...
          IRON MAN SWOOPS down the street. The CHITAURI LEVIATHAN also
          swoops down, BARRELING down the street like a FREIGHT TRAIN that
          keeps building and building its intensity.Banner looks behind.
          Cap looks at him. Banner begins to walk towards the monster.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Dr. Banner. Now might be a really good
           time for you to get angry.

                          BANNER
           That's my secret, Captain. I'm always
           angry.
          Banner's body starts to swell and stretch and harden. GREEN

          SHOOTS THROUGH HIS BODY. THE HULK.
          Aaaannndddd.........SSSMMMAAASSSHHH!!!! HULK POPS the CHITAURI

          LEVIATHAN IN THE NOSE. THE CREATURE FLIPS OVER A 360.
          IRON MAN, in mid-flight, extends his arm out and a ROCKET, ready
          to shoot. IRON MAN FIRES -- the rocket hits a SOFT SPOT Â­ LARGE
          CHITAURI LEVIATHAN are BLOWN COMPLETELY AWAY. Real pain from the
          CHITAURI LEVIATHAN. Other pieces of meat CATCH FIRE and
          withdraw... SIZZLE as they hit the pavement. CAPTAIN AMERICA
          raises his SHIELD to block them.
          From above and on the buildings, the CHITAURI ARMY watches in
          horror as a group of EARTH'S MIGHTIEST HEROES FIND THEMSELVES

          UNITED AGAINST A COMMON THREAT. TO FIGHT THE FOES NO SINGLE

          SUPER HERO COULD WITHSTAND! THE AVENGERS ASSEMBLE!

          EXT. SKY Â­ DAY

          Loki watches below, motionless.

                          LOKI
           Send the rest.

          EXT. VASTNESS OF SPACE

          From the portal, THOUSANDS MORE OF CHITAURI SOLDIERS AND EVEN

          MORE CHITAURI LEVIATHANS FLY OUT!

          EXT. BRIDGE STREET Â­ DAY

          THE AVENGERS look up. Way out of their fucking element.

                          BLACK WIDOW
           Guys.

                          IRON MAN
           Call it, Cap.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Alright, listen up. Until we can close
           that portal up there, we're gonna use
           containment. Barton, I want you on that
           roof, eyes on everything. Call out
           patterns and strays. Stark, you got the
           perimeter. Anything gets more than
           three blocks out, you turn it back or
           your turn it to ash.

                          HAWKEYE
           Wanna give me a lift?

                          IRON MAN
           Right. Better clench up, LEGOLAS.
          IRON MAN lifts HAWKEYE up to the building.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Thor, you've gotta try and bottleneck
           that portal. Slow them down. You've got
           the lightning. Light the bastards up.
           (Thor flies up; to Natasha)
           You and me, we stay here on the ground,
           keep the fighting here. And Hulk.SMASH.

          THE HULK SMILES A MOST MAGNIFICENT GRIN AND LEAPS, SOARING HIGH

          UP INTO THE NEAREST BUILDING, HULK RUNS UP THE WALL HITS SEVERAL

          CHITAURI SOLDIERS, SNAPPING IN HALF.

          HE DIVES TOWARDS A BUILDING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET,
          THROWING THE DEAD CHITAURI SOLDIERS TOWARDS OTHER SOLDIERS. The
          CHITAURI SOLDIERS fire at him. THE HULK BACKHANDS THEM, SEIZES

          THEM AND WITH RAW POWER, THROWS THEM DOWN.

          IN HIS MOST POWERFUL LEAP YET, THE HULK FLIES UP AND IS IN THE

          MIDDLE OF A FLYING CHARIOT TRAFFIC JAM, TO WHICH HE SMACKS THEM

          OUT OF ALTITUDE.

          EXT. EMPIRE STATE BUILDING Â­ DAY

          Thor grabs onto the tower. Raises MJÃ–LNIR and KRAKAKABOOM! A
          BLINDING BOLT OF LIGHTNING strikes down from above, colliding on

          MJÃ–LNIR. THOR AIMS THIS MASSIVE SHOCKWAVE TOWARDS THE PORTAL.

          THOR CHANNELS THE BLAST AND FIRES THE ELECTRICITY OUT AT THE

          CHITAURI SOLDIERS FLYING OUT OF THE PORTAL. THEY'RE BLASTED BACK

          IN A MASSIVE SHOCKWAVE. THE CHITAURI SOLDIERS CONVULSE, DROP

          DEAD TO THE GROUND. HE EVEN RIPS THE SHIT OUT OF A CHITAURI

          LEVIATHAN, WHICH THEN FUCKING EXPLODES.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE Â­ DAY

          Back in the bridge, Fury sees on his VIEWSCREEN the destruction
          going on in NEW YORK. Agent Hill walks up to him.

           AGENT MARIA HILL
           Sir. The council is on.
          OH SHIT. Fury presses his screen.

          EXT. ROOFTOP BUILDING Â­ DAY

          Atop the rooftop, HAWKEYE fires ARROWS into the streaming flow
          of the CHITAURI RIDERS, hitting his mark each time. Hell, heeven
          AIMS his bow behind him, WITHOUT LOOKING and releases the arrow,
          EXPLODING a RIDER.

                          HAWKEYE
           Stark. You got a lot of strings
           sticking to your tail.

                          IRON MAN
           Just try and keep them off the streets.

                          HAWKEYE
           Well, they can't bank worth a damn.
           Find a tight corner.

                          IRON MAN
           I will roger that.
          IRON MAN does so and leads towards TIGHT CORNERS and in
          HAWKEYE'S view, who fires arrow upon and arrow, EXPLODING the
          CHITAURI RIDERS. IRON MAN keeps leading CHITAURI RIDERS UNDER
          TUNNELS, THROUGH OPEN PARKING GARAGES. He looks back. None left.

          INSIDE THE SUIT

                          TONY
           Nice call. What else you got?

           HAWKEYE (V.O.)
           Well, Thor's taking on a squadron down
           on 6th.

                          TONY
           And he didn't invite me?

          EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - CONFERENCE ROOM Â­ DAY

          We are looking INTO a conference room where office workers sit
          around a table. But the NOISE has caught one worker's eye, then
          another, and soon they are all rising, stepping to the window,
          mesmerized by what lies beyond.
          WORKERS' POVA CHITAURI LEVIATHAN SWIMS right in front of them.

          EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - CONFERENCE ROOM Â­ DAY

          Suddenly, another NOISE catches the worker's attention. THE HULK

          CRASHES THROUGH THEIR FLOOR. SLASHES HIS THROUGH THE ROOM,

          POUNDING AWAY AND JUMPS OUT ONTO THE JAW OF THE CHITAURI

          LEVIATHAN. THE CHITAURI LEVIATHAN BEGINS TO HEAD DOWN, TRYING TO

          WAVE OFF THE HULK.

          EXT. BRIDGE STREET Â­ DAY

          BLACK WIDOW, using the ENERGY RIFLE, is taken off her feet by a
          CHITAURI SOLDIER. She TIRESOMELY takes it down by cutting its
          throat. She grabs the ENERGY RIFLE, turns to attack. Cap stands
          there, holding his SHIELD. She slumps back, tired.

                          BLACK WIDOW
           Captain, none of this is gonna mean a
           damn thing if we don't close that
           portal.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Our biggest guns couldn't touch it.

                          BLACK WIDOW
           Well, maybe it's not about guns.
           (gestures the flying

                          CHARIOTS)

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           You wanna get up there, you're gonna
           need a ride.

                          BLACK WIDOW
           I got a ride. I could use a lift
           though.
          BLACK WIDOW backs up giving herself a running start. Cap lifts
          and angles his SHIELD.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Are you sure about this?

                          BLACK WIDOW
           Yeah. It's gonna be fun.

          BLACK WIDOW RUNS AT CAPTAIN AMERICA. BLACK WIDOW DOES A PARKOUR

          MOVE, USING HER FEET TO RUN UP THE CAR AND JUMPS UP ON CAP'S

          SHIELD, WHO GIVES HER A BOOST WITH THE SHIELD. SHE GRABS ONTO A

          FLYING CHARIOT.
          [Note: The following sequence will take us through the action in
          one extended shot.]
          - BLACK WIDOW climbs onto the chariot and CUTS the turret
          shooter's linkage to it. She then JUMPS on the rider and STICKS
          her knives into his nervous system. She gets him to BANK over a
          building.
          - IRON MAN arrives and SHOOTS any other CHITAURI RIDERS
          following her. He makes his way down to CAPTAIN AMERICA, who
          fights off more CHITAURI SOLDIERS. IRON MAN points his HAND
          BOOSTERS at his SHIELD. The energy comes off and Cap uses it as
          a REFLECTION BEAM and takes down nearby CHITAURI.
          - From above them, HAWKEYE sends down remaining arrows. He sends
          one across the street, taking down a CHITAURI RIDER following

          IRON MAN.
          - Finally, we have THOR and HULK fight on top the back of the
          CHITAURI LEVIATHAN, tearing apart and fighting SOLDIERS. HULK

          BREAKS OFF A MASSIVE PIECE OF ARMOR AND SLAMS IT DOWN ONTO THE
          SPINE OF THE CHITAURI LEVIATHAN. Summoning all his strength he,

          THOR RAISES, DRAWING LIGHTNING TO IT FROM ALL SIDES, AND BRINGS

          IT DOWN WITH A FINAL, TERRIBLE BLOW--

          INT. HISTORY MUSEUM Â­ DAY

          The CHITAURI LEVIATHAN CRASHES into a history museum. DEAD. THOR
          and HULK stand on the BACK of the CHITAURI LEVIATHAN after
          bringing it down. They stand still, admiring. HULK PUNCHES THOR

          WITH HIS ENORMOUS HAND. THOR GOES FLYING. HULK SMIRKS.

          EXT. STARK TOWER Â­ DAY

          SELVIG WAKES UP FROM LOKI MIND CONTROL. He looks around,
          confused where he is. He looks up at the sky, amazed.

          EXT. BRIDGE STREET Â­ DAY

          Several HUMVEES aim their MOUNTED .50 Cal guns into the sky,
          FIRING and HITTING CHITAURI RIDERS. CAPTAIN AMERICA fights off a
          SOLDIER who is pinning him down with its energy rifle. Cap
          BREAKS ITS LEG. He stands up, pickingup his SHILED.

                          HAWKEYE
           Captain, the bank on 42ndpast MADISON,
           they caught a lot of civilians there.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           I'm on it.

          INT. 42NDBANK Â­ DAY

          Dozens of civilians are gathered in bank. Tension and
          uncertainty surround them. THREE CHITAURI SOLDIERS oversee them,
          pointing their weapons at them. One of them charges a BOMB. It

          BEEPS.
          CAPTAIN AMERICA jumps through the window and throws his SHIELD
          at the CHITAURI BOMBER. The TWO CHITAURI SOLDIERS aim their
          rifles, but Cap heads for cover under a desk, which he KICKS at
          them.
          CAPTAIN AMERICA jumps over the desk, HEADLOCKS A SOLDIER, while
          BACKHANDING another one over the railing. The crowd moves away.
          A CHITAURI SOLDIER attacks him from behind and RIPS OFF HIS
          HELMET. The bomb is beeping faster.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Everyone! Clear out!
          CAPTAIN AMERICA flips over the SOLDIER, grabs his SHIELD and
          just as the BOMB is about to GO OFF, CHITAURI BOMBER dives for,
          trying to stop it, but it GOES OFF, sending CAPTAIN AMERICA
          through the window, landing very hard on a car. The civilians
          look up from below. They're okay.

          EXT. OUTSIDE THE BANK Â­ CONTINUOUS

          Cap gets off the car, looks around the city. Destroyed. The
          police and firemen arrive, pulling out those civilians he saved.
          A WAITRESS looks back, thankful.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE Â­ DAY

          Back in the bridge, Fury sees on his VIEWSCREEN the WORLD

          SECURITY COUNCIL.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #2
           Director Fury, the council has made a
           decision.

                          NICK FURY
           I recognize the council has made a
           decision, but given that it's a stupid
           ass decision, I've elected to ignore
           it.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1
           Director, you're closer than any of
           oursubs, you scramble that jet...

                          NICK FURY
           That is the island of Manhattan,
           Councilman. Until I'm certain my team
           can't hold it, I will not order a
           nuclear strike against a civilian
           population.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1
           If we don't hold them in the air, we
           lose everything.

                          NICK FURY
           I send that bird out, we already have.
          Fury shuts off his viewscreen.

          EXT. MANHATTAN Â­ DAY

          BLACK WIDOW, still driving the chariot with the RIDER, is hit at
          her side. She looks about, wondering whose ENERGY FIRE it was
          she looks behind.

                          BLACK WIDOW
           Oh. You.
          LOKI FOLLOWS IN HOT PURSUIT. They RACE DOWNWARD, trailing
          between buildings. They RACE MADLY, driving and dodging.

          EXT. ROOFTOP BUILDING Â­ DAY

          HAWKEYE looks at BLACK WIDOW, astonished.

                          HAWKEYE
           Nat, what are you doing?

           BLACK WIDOW (V.O.)
           Uh... a little help!
          HAWKEYE pulls the trigger twice, nocks an arrow, and points it
          at Loki, smiling.

                          HAWKEYE
           I've got him.

          FIRES. THE ARROW STREAKS DOWN THE CITY, STRAIGHT AT THE LOKI'S

          HEAD...

          SNATCH! LIKE A CAT, LOKI GRABS THE ARROW STRAIGHT OUT OF THE

          AIR...LOOKS STRAIGHT AT HAWKEYE, SMILING...

          BBOOOOMMM!!! THE ARROW EXPLODES IN LOKI'S FACE, CRASHING INTO

          THE STARK PENTHOUSE PAD.
          BLACK WIDOW looks down and building her momentum, she JUMPS of
          the chariot, lands on top of STARK TOWER, rolling herself to the
          edge.

          EXT/INT. STARK PENTHOUSE Â­ DAY

          As Loki looks up, shocked at what just happened, THE HULK IS
          LEAPING UP AND KICKS LOKI, HURTLING TOWARDS THE GLASS WINDOW. He
          COLLAPSES as he hits the wall. THE HULK jumps in, ready to
          attack. Loki ROLLS himself up in a flurry of broken glass,

          STANDING UP TO THE HULK.

                          LOKI

           ENOUGH! YOU ARE, ALL OF YOU ARE BENEATH

           ME! I AM A GOD, YOU DULL CREATURE, AND

           I WILL NOT BE BULLIED...

          HULK GRABS LOKI BY THE LEGS AND SMASHES HIM AGAINST THE FLOOR

          REPEATEDLY AND FINALLY THROWS HIM ASIDE TO THE GROUND,

          FLATTENING LOKI.

                          HULK

           PUNY GOD.

          LOKI WHIMPERS IN PAIN.

          EXT. STARK TOWER Â­ DAY

          BLACK WIDOW walks up the CMS machine. Selvig, slumped down,
          weakened, looks at her desperately. The Tesseract's energy is
          firing towards the portal, gaining in strength, at the surge of
          energy moving through the sky.

                          BLACK WIDOW
           Doctor.

                          SELVIG
           Loki's scepter, the energy...the
           Tesseract can't fight. You can't
           protect against yourself.

                          BLACK WIDOW
           It's not your fault. You didn't know
           what you were doing.

                          SELVIG
           Well, actually I think I did. I built
           in a safety to cut the power source.

                          BLACK WIDOW
           Loki's scepter.

                          SELVIG
           It might be able to close the portal.
           (Selvig looks down. He sees a

                          GOLD GLEAM)
           And I'm looking right at it.

          EXT. MANHATTAN Â­ DAY

          THOR rides on top of chariot, SMACKING SEVERAL RIDERS with the
          hammer. As Thor takes the reins, a CHITAURI LEVIATHAN crashes
          through a building, knocking him down to where Cap is, fighting
          off SOLDIERS.
          IRON MAN flies right next to the CHITAURI LEVIATHAN and aims his
          LASER BOOSTER at it. Nothing.

                          JARVIS
           Sir, we will lose power before you cut
           through that shell.
          IRON MAN flies up ahead, facing the oncoming monster.

                          IRON MAN
           JARVIS. You ever hear the tale of
           Jonah?

                          JARVIS
           I wouldn't consider him a role model.

          IRON MAN FLIES TOWARDS THE CHITAURI LEVIATHAN, UNLEASHING EVERY
          ARSENAL ON THE SUIT. The CHITAURI LEVIATHAN opens its mouth.
          IRON MAN flies in and BURSTS out the other end, making the
          CHITAURI LEVIATHAN collapse. IRON MAN rolls down the street. The
          wind is knocked out of him. He looks up with an overwhelming
          sigh as a SMALL BAND of CHITAURI SOLDIERS rush towards him,
          holding out their rifles.

          EXT. ROOFTOP BUILDING Â­ DAY

          HAWKEYE turns to fire HIS LAST ARROW. Using his bow as a staff,
          he knocks some CHITAURI SOLDIERS, before yanking his last arrow
          off the dead body a CHITAURI SOLDIERS.
          HAWKEYE nocks his arrow, DIVES DOWN THE BUILDING and FIRES his
          GRAPPLING ARROW up into the side of building. Falling down,
          HAWKEYE finds the MOMENTUM and SWINGS himself into a building
          and CANNONBALLS in.

          EXT. MANHATTAN Â­ DAY

          The HULK holds CHITAURI SOLDIERS by the face and SLAMS them
          down. More keep coming. HULK looks up. HUNDREDS OF RIDERS HOVER
          OVER HIM. Then... they begin to fire ENERGY BLASTS. HULK TAKES

          THEM LIKE HE'S RUNNING THROUGH A LIGHT RAIN. BLOCKING THE STREAM

          OF STREAKING BLASTS, AS THOUGH SWATTING AT BEES.

          EXT. HELICARRIER DECK Â­ DAY

          A lone pilot sits in his cockpit, listening.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #2
           DIRECTOR FURY is no longer in command.
           Override order, 7 ALPHA 11.

          Back in the bridge, Agent Hill sees on her SCREEN 7 ALPHA 11
          preparing to leave.

           AGENT MARIA HILL
           Sir, we have a bird in motion! Anyone
           on the deck, we have a rogue bird! We
           need to shut it down! Repeat! Take off
           is not authorized!

          EXT. HELICARRIER DECK Â­ DAY


          NICK FURY RUNS OUT TO THE DECK, HOLDING A FUCKING AIRTRONIC RPG-
          7. He takes AIM and FIRES, HITTING the TAIL END of the jet. The
          jet SKIDS OFF towards the edge. PILOT UNHARMED.
          Suddenly, another 7 ALPHA 11 JET FLIES off. Fury stands there,
          knowing he can't do anything about it.

                          NICK FURY
           Stark, you hearing me? We have a
           missile headed straight for the city.

           IRON MAN (V.O.)
           How long?

                          NICK FURY
           Three minutes, at best. Stay low and
           wipe out the missile.

          EXT. MANHATTAN Â­ DAY

          IRON MAN fights off as many CHITAURI SOLDIERS as he sustain.

                          IRON MAN
           Jarvis, put everything we got into the
           thrusters!

                          JARVIS
           I just did.
          IRON MAN leaves the streets and flies up into the sky.

          EXT. SKY Â­ DAY

          7 ALPHA 11 arrives outside the city. He flips the switch to
          press the button. He presses it. THE MISSILE IS FLYING OUT TO

          MANHATTAN.

                          7 ALPHA 11
           Destination is in 2 minutes, 30 seconds
           mark.

          EXT. MANHATTAN Â­ DAY

          CAPTAIN AMERICA AND THOR BATTLE, SIDE TO SIDE. Cap and Thor both
          throw their respected weapons. Thor catches MJÃ–LNIR, but as Cap
          turns, an ENERGY BLAST strikes him down hard. Thor runs over to
          a broken car, swings the hammer and flips the car over and over
          on its side, crushing a few CHITAURI SOLDIERS.
          Cap tries to get up. Thor helps him back to his feet. Cap raises
          his SHIELD back up.

                          THOR
           You ready for another bout?

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           What? You gettin' sleepy?

          EXT. STARK TOWER Â­ DAY

          Selvig, back in scientist mode, CLACKS away at his laptop.
          Henods. BLACK WIDOW grabs Loki's scepter, slowly breaks into the
          FORCE FIELD, almost touching the Tesseract.

                          BLACK WIDOW
           I can close it! Can anybody hear me? I
           can shut the portal down!

          EXT. MANHATTAN Â­ DAY


                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Do it!

           IRON MAN (V.O.)
           No, wait!

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Stark, these things are still coming!

          INSIDE THE SUIT

                          TONY
           I got a nuke coming in, it's gonna blow
           in less than a minute. And I know just
           where to put it.

          EXT. SKY Â­ DAY

          IRON MAN catches up, now comes at the missile from behind. The
          missile speeds on. IRON MAN grabs it from behind, gripping it
          tightly.
          With a mighty effort, he wrenches the rocket off its course.
          Steering it from behind, he accelerates quickly, flying straight
          up into sky, towards the portal.

          INSIDE THE SUIT

           CAPTAIN AMERICA (V.O.)
           Stark, you know that's a one-way trip?

                          TONY

                          (TO JARVIS)
           Save the rest for return, J.

                          JARVIS
           Sir. Shall I call Miss Potts?

                          IRON MAN
           You might as well.

          INT. STARK JET Â­ DAY

          PEPPER, along with her crew, watches on T.V., in horror, the
          destruction in NEW YORK. On the table, her cell is VIBRATING,
          with Tony's picture on it.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE Â­ DAY

          Back in the bridge, every single agent holds their breath as
          they too watch IRON MAN fly up into the portal.

          EXT. SKY Â­ DAY

          IRON MAN climbs higher and higher over the city, gaining speed,
          suddenly flings himself through the portal. Communications die.
          The suit begins to freeze. Tony looks in horror.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE Â­ DAY

          Every single agent CHEERS. Fury smiles. He tries to communicate
          with Tony. NOTHING.

          EXT. SPACE

          We then see Tony's horror. AN ARMADA. The black sky is filled
          with what must be ninety ships in a vague cluster. Most of them
          hang still in the air. Some move swimmingly about.
          IRON MAN lets go of the missile. It whistles off into the
          blackness as IRON MAN IDLY falls back down the portal's opening.
          The missile reaches the MAIN SHIP. The MAIN SHIP IMPLODES,
          causing the entire ARMADA to burst into a supernova, creating a
          spectacular heavenly display.

          EXT. MANHATTAN Â­ DAY

          Suddenly, all of the CHITAURI SOLDIERS and CHITAURI LEVIATHANS
          KEEL OVER and begin to SHAKE, then stop. They all fall over. THE
          AVENGERS look up at their CONSULTANT, not sure if he'll make it
          through.

          EXT. STARK TOWER Â­ DAY

          Still holding the scepter in hand, BLACK WIDOW shifts around,
          waiting.

                          BLACK WIDOW
           Come on, Stark...

          EXT. MANHATTAN Â­ DAY

          Thor and Cap see the supernova coming towards them. Thor nods to
          Cap.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           (to BLACK WIDOW)
           Close it.

          EXT. STARK TOWER Â­ DAY

          Without hesitating, BLACK WIDOW pulls the scepter out, the
          TESSERACT turns off its energy beam. The PORTAL QUICKLY CLOSES.
          A SMALL FIGURE is hurled backwards into the open now closed
          portal. IRON MAN. Plummeting to the earth.

          EXT. MANHATTAN Â­ DAY


                          CAPTAIN AMERICA

           Son of a gun!
          TIGHT ON IRON MAN: He keeps falling. And falling. And falling.

          EXT. MANHATTAN Â­ DAY


                          THOR
           He's not slowing down.
          Thor swings MjÃ¶lnir around. Just as Thor flies up, THE HULK

          SNAGS IRON MAN OUT OF THE AIR, BOTH CRASHING AND SLIDING DOWN A

          BUILDING.

          EXT. BRIDGE STREET Â­ DAY

          HULK throws IRON MAN off him. Thor and Cap run over to him. Thor
          RIPS off Tony's helmet. He appears to be dead. They stand around
          not sure. Then... THE HULK YELLS IN FURY. THE NOISE STARTLES

          TONY AWAKE.

                          TONY
           What the hell? What just happened?
           Please tell me nobody kissed me?

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA

                          (A BEAT)
           We won.

                          TONY
           Alright. Hey. Alright. Good job, guys.
           Let's just not come in tomorrow. Let's
           just take a day. Have you ever tried
           shawarma? There's a shawarma joint
           about two blocks from here. I don't
           know what it is, but I wanna try it.

                          THOR
           (looking up at Stark Tower)
           We're not finished yet.
          A beat.

                          TONY
           And then shawarma after.

          INT. STARK PENTHOUSE Â­ DAY

          Loki crawls onto the stair, looking like a piece of shit rag
          doll. He takes a few breathers, senses someone is behind him. He
          turns TO FIND THE AVENGERS STARING AT HIM, PISSED.

                          LOKI
           If it's all the same to you. I'll have

          THE HULK SNORTS AT HIM.

          WEEKS LATER.

          INT. SHIELD ANALYTICAL ROOM Â­ DAY

          In TV news montage about THE AVENGERS, we see various reports of
          what happened. Some people agree that the avengers did good,
          protecting the city. Others believe it was their cause.

           OLD MAN (STAN LEE)
           Superheroes? In New York? Give me a
           break!

                          SENATOR BOYNTON
           These so called heroes have to be held
           responsible for the destruction done to
           the city. This was their fight. Where
           are they now?

                          WAITRESS
           What? That this was somehow their
           fault? Captain America saved my life.
           Wherever he is, wherever any of them
           are, I just wanna say thank you.

          EXT. CENTRAL PARK Â­ DAY

          The Avengers take Thor and Loki, who is handcuffed and muzzled,
          to a blocked area. Thor shakes hands with his team and gives
          Selvig a hug. Tony opens the Tesseract's case.
          Banner takes it out and places inside a glass tube, held by
          Thor. Thor gives Loki the other end, who reluctantly takes it.
          The Asgardians leap into the energy beam. GONE.
          Then, one-by-one, the group splinters off, strolling into
          different directions. Banner climbs in with Tony in his
          sportscar. Steve rides away in his Harley. Natasha and Clint
          climb back into SHIELD cars. They all part. For now.

          INT. SHIELD ANALYTICAL ROOM Â­ DAY

          Fury is facing once more members of the WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #3
           Where are the Avengers?

                          NICK FURY
           I'm not currently tracking their
           whereabouts. I'd say they've earned a
           leave of absence.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #2
           And the Tesseract?

                          NICK FURY
           The Tesseract is where it belongs: out
           of our reach.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1
           That's not your call.

                          NICK FURY
           I didn't make it. I just didn't argue
           with the god that did.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1
           So you let him take it and the war
           criminal, Loki, who should be answering
           for his crimes?

                          NICK FURY
           Oh, I think he will be.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1
           I don't think you understand what
           you've started. Letting the Avengers
           loose on this world. They're dangerous.

                          NICK FURY
           They surely are. And the whole world
           knows it. Every world knows it.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1
           Was that the point of all this? A
           statement?

                          NICK FURY
           A promise.

          Fury walks out, towards the bridge.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE Â­ DAY

          Fury and Agent Hill walk together, toward the window looking out
          into the world.

                         AGENT MARIA HILL
           Sir, how does it work now? They've gone
           their separate ways, some pretty
           extremely far. We get into a situation
           like this again, what happens then?

                          NICK FURY
           They'll come back.

           AGENT MARIA HILL
           You really sure about that?

                          NICK FURY
           I am.

           AGENT MARIA HILL
           Why?

                          NICK FURY
           Because we'll need them to.

          Agent Hill turns around. Fury looks out, smiling.

     Dark and cramped. The soft red light of fire seeps through
     iron slats. Inside this cage is a man, bound by chains.

     It's THOR. His beard is long and his clothes are worn. That
     rough, grizzled look of a man who's spent years on the road.

     He awakens with a JOLT.   Looks around.

                           THOR
                 Now I know what you're thinking.
                 Oh no! Thor's in a cage. How did
                 this happen?
                     (then:)
                 Well, sometimes you have to get
                 captured just to get a straight
                 answer out of somebody. It's a long
                 story but basically I'm a bit of a
                 hero. See, I spent some time on
                 earth, fought some robots, saved
                 the planet a couple of times. Then
                 I went searching through the cosmos
                 for some magic, colorful Infinity
                 Stone things... didn't find any.
                 That's when I came across a path of
                 death and destruction which led me
                 all the way here into this cage...
                 where I met you.

     Reveal that he's talking to a weird alien skeleton in chains.

                           THOR (CONT'D)
                 How much longer do you think we'll
                 be here?

     NOISE.    Sounds of metal gears TURNING.

     Suddenly the bottom DROPS OUT! Thor PLUMMETS until - SHLINK!
     Chains CINCH and abruptly halt his descent. Thor dangles six
     feet off the ground. Pull back to reveal we are in-
                                              .


   INT. SURTUR'S LAIR - CONTINUOUS                                  

    A cavernous space. The walls, floors, and ceilings are
    molten rock, which has creepy glimmers of fire within it.
    Stationed in the center is a volcanic rock throne, and
    sitting in that throne is a charred demonic skeleton.

                        SURTUR (O.S.)
              Thor, Son of Odin.

    Thor's chain turns to reveal-

    -SURTUR on his throne. Eighteen-feet-tall, flesh made of
    fire, and demonic spiked horns on his skull.

                         THOR
              Surtur. Son of a bitch...you're
              still alive! I thought my father
              killed you, like, half a million
              years ago.

                        SURTUR
              I cannot die. Not until I fulfill
              my destiny and lay waste to your
              home.

                        THOR
              You know, it's funny you should
              mention that because I've been
              having these terrible dreams of
              late. Asgard up in flames, falling
              to ruins, and you Surtur are at the
              center of all of them.

                        SURTUR
              Then you have seen Ragnarok, the
              fall of Asgard. The great prophecy--

                         THOR (O.S.)
              Hang on.   Hang on.

    Reveal that Thor's chain is turning VERY SLOWLY.

                        THOR (CONT'D)
              I'll be back around shortly. I
              really feel like we were connecting
              there.

    After a beat, Thor rotates around to face Surtur.

                        THOR (CONT'D)
              Okay, so, Ragnarok. Tell me about
              that. Walk me through it.
                                  .


                    SURTUR
          My time has come. When my crown is
          reunited with the Eternal Flame, I
          shall be restored to my full might.
          I will tower over the mountains and
          bury my sword deep in Asgard's--

                    THOR
          Oh, hang on. Give it a second.

Once again, Thor is turning VERY SLOWLY.

                    THOR (CONT'D)
          I swear I'm not even moving, it's
          just doing this on its own. I'm
          really sorry.
              (then:)
          Okay, let me get this straight.
          You're going to put your crown into
          the Eternal Flame, and then you'll
          suddenly grow as big as a house--

                    SURTUR
          A mountain!

                    THOR
          The Eternal Flame that Odin keeps
          locked away on Asgard?

Surtur grins, evil.

                    SURTUR
          Odin is not on Asgard. And your
          absence has left the throne
          defenseless.

That elicits a concerned look from Thor.

                    THOR
          Okay, so where is it? This crown?

                    SURTUR
          This is my Crown, the source of my
          power.

Surtur points at the V-shaped horns on his head..

                    THOR
          Oh, that's a crown? I thought it
          was a big eyebrow.

                    SURTUR
          It's a crown.
                                          .


                     THOR
           Anyway, it sounds like all I have
           to do to stop Ragnarok is rip that
           thing off your head.

Surtur stands up and approaches Thor, DRAGGING his sword.

                     SURTUR
           But Ragnarok has   already begun. You
           cannot stop it.    I am Asgard's
           doom, and so are   you. All will
           suffer, all will   burn.

Surtur steps forward and GRABS the chain above Thor's feet,
holding it so he and Thor are face to face.

                     THOR
           That's intense. To be honest,
           seeing you grow really big and set
           fire to a planet would be quite the
           spectacle. But it looks like I'm
           going to have to go with option B
           where I bust out of these chains,
           knock that tiara off your head, and
           stash it away in Asgard's vault.

                     SURTUR
           You cannot stop Ragnarok. Why fight
           it?

Behind his back, Thor opens his hand.    Sending out the SOS.

                     THOR
           Because that's what heroes do.

Nothing happens.   Thor appears annoyed at himself.

                     THOR (CONT'D)
           Wait, sorry. I didn't time that
           right.
               (pause)
           And, now!

BOOM!   Thor's hammer Mjolnir CRASHES through the wall!

Thor BREAKS FREE from his chains, GRABS Mjolnir, spins, and
flies a distance away. He FLINGS Mjolnir back at Surtur,
smashing the giant in the face. Mjolnir returns.

                     SURTUR
           You have made a grave mistake,
           Odinson.
                                              .


    THE WALLS COME ALIVE! A seemingly infinite swarm of FIRE
    DEMONS rally to Surtur's aid.

                         THOR
               I make grave mistakes all the time.
               Everything seems to work out.

    In the shadows, a massive FIRE DRAGON ROARS.

    The fire demons SURGE FORWARD. Thor backs up, HAMMERING
    AWAY. He then leaps back, SPRINGBOARDS off the wall, and-

    -LANDS HARD, SLAMMING Mjolnir down. The resulting shockwave
    KNOCKS BACK THE LEGION OF FIRE DEMONS.

    The Fire Dragon STRAINS against a chain leash.

    Thor is now facing off with Surtur. Surtur thrusts his hands
    at Thor, generating a humongous PROJECTILE WALL OF FIRE!

    Thor SPINS Mjolnir so fast that it creates a kind of SHIELD.

    The God of Thunder and the Fire Giant engage in ferocious
    hand-to-hand combat. Each landing power shots, sending
    sparks of both fire and electricity into the air.

    Thor SLIPS behind Surtur and TAKES OUT his knees. Thor then
    LAUNCHES HIGH into the air and summons a HUGE LIGHTNING BOLT.
    Descending hard, he uses all his power to-

    -LOP SURTUR'S HEAD OFF OF HIS BODY! Surtur's body DEFLATES
    and COLLAPSES into a heap of charred bones.

    Thor straps the crowned skull to his back. He turns to find-

    -the army of Fire Demons regrouping as reinforcements flood
    in, filling the space to capacity. Recognizing the threat,
    Thor thrusts Mjolnir above his head.

                         THOR (CONT'D)
               Heimdall. I know it's been a while,
               but I could use a fast exit!

    Nothing.   Thor just stands there as the Fire Demons advance.

                         THOR (CONT'D)
               ...Heimdall?


   INT. THE OBSERVATORY - SAME                                      

    Heimdall is nowhere to be found. Instead, we meet SKURGE.
    He's bald, strong, mean looking, a little eager to be liked.
                                              .


    At the moment, Skurge is entertaining two ASGARDIAN WOMEN.

                         SKURGE
              Heimdall was an idiot. This job
              should have made him rich. Now,
              the job ain't easy, but it does
              have its benefits. The Bi-Frost
              gives me access to everything the
              Nine Realms have to offer. I mean
              it's all mine for the taking.
                  (beat)
              Behold...my stuff.

    Skurge has drawn their attention to a pile of weapons and
    treasures he has stashed off to the side.

    He hefts up two M- assault rifles, trying to play it cool.

                        SKURGE (CONT'D)
              I'm particularly fond of these. I
              pulled `em out of a place on
              Midgard called Texas. I even named
              them. Des and Troy. You see, when
              you put them together...they
              destroy.


   INT. SURTUR'S LAIR - CONTINUOUS                                  

    Having expected to have been Bi-Frosted out of there, Thor is
    OVERRUN BY THE GIANT WAVE OF FIRE DEMONS!

    The Fire Dragon BREAKS FREE of its chain.

    Realizing he's in trouble, Thor TAKES OFF, rocketing up to-


   EXT. MUSPELHEIM - CONTINUOUS                                     

    Thor CRASHES out of the ground and LANDS on a craggy surface.
    Disoriented and singed from the fire demon onslaught.

    Thor's cloak is on fire, and he frantically PATS OUT the
    flames. He picks up Mjolnir, holds it up once more. Nothing.

                        THOR
              Heimdall, come on.

    THE GROUND SHAKES! Like an earthquake. Thor backs up as the
    ground begins to give way all around him. And then-

    -THE FEARSOME FIRE DRAGON BURSTS OUT OF THE GROUND! The
    dragon opens its tremendous jaws for an ear-splitting roar...
                                             .


     ...but Thor STUFFS Mjolnir into its mouth and lets go.

     THUD! The hammer DROPS, pinning the beast down by its bottom
     jaw. It THRASHES and GROWLS, trying to break free.

                         THOR (CONT'D)
               Stay.
                   (looks up to the sky:)
               I'm running short on--

     Thor notices that all around him the ground is CRUMBLING like
     a field of sinkholes giving way to more snarling Fire Demons!

                           THOR (CONT'D)
               -options.

     Thor calls for Mjolnir and TAKES OFF.   The dragon SCREECHES!

               Heimdall?

     Behind Skurge the Bi-Frost starts MOVING.   One of the women
     notices the Bi-Frost glowing.

                         ASGARDIAN WOMAN
               Skurge, is that important?

     Skurge turns and notices the Bi-Frost activity.

                         SKURGE
               You girls are in for a treat.

     Angle on Heimdall's sword, which has been sloppily cast aside
     in another pile of "stuff." Skurge hastily runs and grabs it.

     Thor is FLYING at top speed, but that dragon is right on his
     heels! The fire demons LAUNCH flaming projectiles from below!

     Thor looks back, genuinely nervous. The dragon is OPENING
     its jaws to swallow Thor whole when-

     -Suddenly Bi-Frost OPENS! The portal surrounds Thor and
     engulfs the dragon's head! In an instant, they're gone.

     Skurge has plunged Heimdall's sword into Bi-Frost.

     BOOM! Thor EXPLODES out of the portal along with the severed
     head of the dragon! SPLAT! Blood and guts RAIN DOWN on
     Skurge and the two women, DRENCHING them with purple gore.

     The dragon's head SLIDES slowly across the floor, coming to
     rest right in front of the women who are frozen in shock.

     The women SHRIEK and rush out of the Observatory. Thor
     meanwhile is clean and sgering back to his feet. He looks
     up to Skurge, who is wiping dragon guts off of himself.

               Well well, look who decided to pop
               in. Thanks for scaring away my
               company and drenching my workplace
               in brains.

                         THOR
               Who are you?

                         SKURGE
               Don't you remember? I'm Skurge.
                   (Thor doesn't)
               We fought together on Vanaheim.

                          THOR
               Right.   Where's Heimdall?

                         SKURGE
               That traitor. No one knows, he's a
               fugitive of the throne.

                          THOR
               Traitor?

                         SKURGE
               Yeah, you see, Odin charged
               Heimdall with negligence of duty,
               but he disappeared before the
               trial. Hard to catch a guy who can
               see everything in the Universe.

     Thor starts to say something, but then gives up. Instead he
     starts towards the exit... but Skurge stands in his way.
                                                .


                             THOR
                Sure.

                          SKURGE
                Hold on. I'm supposed to announce
                your arrival.

      Thor SPINS UP Mjolnir and takes off in a blur.   Skurge starts
      the loooong run down the Rainbow Bridge.

      THOR arrives with Surtur's skull.

      There's a small crowd making its way through a threshold over
      which stands a monumental statue of Loki, arms out-stretched
      in the `savior' pose.

      Confused, Thor turns to a theater patron.

                What the hell is that?

      LOKI falls into frame, GASPING FOR BREATH... although it's
      not Loki. This is ACTOR LOKI and we're watching a SE PLAY.

      In the background, a single musician plays the haunting score
      from THOR: THE DARK WORLD on a pan flute.

      Suddenly, ACTOR THOR leans into shot, holding Actor Loki.

                          ACTOR LOKI
                Oh, brother. This is it.    I take
                my leave.

                          ACTOR THOR
                You fool, you didn't listen!

      "Sif" awkwardly runs off. The "Warriors Three" watch sadly. A
      small choir JOINS IN as the music builds to a CRESCENDO.

                          ACTOR SIF
                Somebody help!
                                      0.


In the middle of the audience we reveal ODIN, sitting upon a
chaise lounge, sipping wine and thoroughly enjoying the show.
Unseen, Thor arrives behind the audience and watches.

                    ACTOR LOKI
          Sorry for all I've done.

                    ACTOR THOR
          It's all right.   Hold on.

                    ACTOR LOKI
          I'm sorry I tried to rule Earth.

                    ACTOR THOR
          They'd be lucky to have you.

                    ACTOR LOKI
          I'm sorry about that thing with the
          Tesseract. I just couldn't help
          myself.

                    ACTOR THOR
          I know.

                    ACTOR LOKI
          I'm a trickster.

                    ACTOR THOR
          So mischievous.

                    ACTOR LOKI
          Sorry about that time I turned you
          into a frog.

                    ACTOR THOR
          It was a wonderful joke.

                    ODIN
              (to no-one in particular)
          Twas indeed hilarious.

                    ACTOR THOR
          You are the savior of Asgard.

                    ACTOR LOKI
          Tell my story.

                    ACTOR THOR
          I will.

                    ACTOR LOKI
          Build a statue for me.
                                        .


                    ACTOR THOR
          We will build a big statue for you.

                    ACTOR LOKI
          With my helmet on, with the big
          bendy horns.

                    ACTOR THOR
          I will tell Father what you did
          here today.

Odin mouths Actor Loki's final line along with him.

                    ACTOR LOKI
          I didn't do it for him.

Actor Loki then "dies".

                       ACTOR THOR
          Noooooo!!!

The brothers freeze in a TABLEAU as ACTOR ODIN steps forward.

                    ACTOR ODIN
          And so Loki died of his wounds,
          giving his life for ours. He
          fought back those disgusting dark
          elves. He brought peace to the
          realm.

He takes a -YEAR-OLD BOY, PAINTED BLUE, into his arms.

                    ACTOR ODIN (CONT'D)
          Loki, my boy...`Twas many moons ago
          I found you on a frost-bitten
          battlefield.

Thor watches, incredulous. He then notices that a woman next
to him is openly SOBBING at the play.

                    ACTOR ODIN (CONT'D)
          On that day, I did not yet see in
          you Asgard's savior. No. You were
          merely a little blue baby icicle...
          that melted this old fool's heart.

The crowd erupts in rapturous applause. The players bow. Odin
stands up, leading the crowd in this STANDING OVATION.

                      ODIN
          Bravo!    Bravo! Well done.   Bravo.

                       THOR
          Father.
                                         .


Odin sees Thor taking a knee.   Curses under his breath:

                    ODIN
          Oh, shit.
              (then, announcing)
          My son! Thor has returned!
          Greetings my boy.

Odin goes through a weird internal transformation. His
fluidity is replaced by a rigid and regal posture. He bats
away his maiden and turns to Thor, who stands up.

                     THOR
          It's an interesting play.    What's
          it called?

                    ODIN
          The Tragedy of Loki of Asgard. The
          people wanted to commemorate him.

                    THOR
          Indeed they should.
              (provoking)
          I like that statue. A lot better
          looking than he was when he was
          alive, though. A little less
          weasely. Less greasy maybe.

Odin sours, masking his agitation.    Thor holds up the skull.

                    THOR (CONT'D)
          You know what this is?

                    ODIN (ADR)
          The skull of Surtur? That's a
          formidable weapon.

Thor approaches an E-Guard and hands it over.

                    THOR
          Do me a favor. Lock this in a
          vault so it doesn't turn into a
          giant monster and destroy the whole
          planet.

                    ODIN
          So it's back to Midgard for you, is
          it?

Thor starts YO-YOing Mjolnir, turns back to Odin.

                    THOR
          Nope. I've been having this
          reocurring dream lately.
                    (MORE)
                                      .

                    THOR (CONT'D)
          Every night I see Asgard fall into
          ruins...

                    ODIN
          That's just a silly dream... Signs
          of an overactive imagination.

                    THOR
          Possibly... but then I decide to go
          out there and investigate. And
          what do I find, but the Nine Realms
          completely in chaos. Enemies of
          Asgard assembling, plotting our
          demise, all while you, Odin, the
          protector of those Nine Realms, are
          sitting here in your bathrobe,
          eating grapes.

                    ODIN
          Well, it is best to respect our
          neighbors' freedom.

                     THOR
          Of course, the freedom to be
          massacred.

                    ODIN
          Yes, besides, I have been rather
          busy myself.

                    THOR
          Watching theatre.

                    ODIN
          Board meetings, and security
          council meetings...

                    THOR
          You really going to make me do it?

                     ODIN
          Do what?

Thor SPINS Mjolnir and then HURLS it off into the distance,
GRABS Odin by the back of the neck.

Odin's royal attendants GASP in shock. The Einherjar
bodyguards rush Thor, but he KICKS them away.

                    THOR
          You know that nothing will stop
          Mjolnir as it returns to my hand.

Mjolnir stops mid-air and starts ROCKETING BACK.
                                       .


                    THOR (CONT'D)
          Not even your face.

                    ODIN
          You've gone quite mad.     You'll be
          executed for this!

Mjolnir approaches at a terrifying speed as Odin struggles.

                    THOR
          Then I'll see you on the other
          side...brother.

The jig is up.   A shimmering illusion dissipates, revealing:

                    LOKI
          Alright, I yield!

Thor DROPS Loki to the ground and catches Mjolnir. Loki
looks to Thor, hands up defensively. Skurge arrives on the
scene, a little late to warn Loki.

                     SKURGE
          Behold!   Thor..Odinson.

                    LOKI
          You had one job!    Just the one.

                    THOR
          Where's Odin?

                    LOKI
          You just couldn't stay away, could
          you? Everything was fine without
          you. Asgard was prospering
              (gestures to the crowd)
          You've ruined everything. Ask
          them.

Those who aren't freaked out are becoming gradually angrier.

Thor advances on Loki, who backs up onto the chaise lounge.

                    THOR
          Where's father?    Did you kill him?

                    LOKI
          You had what you wanted, you had
          the independence you asked for!

Thor PRESSES Mjolnir onto Loki's chest.
                                            .


                         LOKI (CONT'D)
               Ow-ow-ow! Alright! I know exactly
               where he is.

   EXT. SHADY ACRES NURSING HOME - MANHATTAN - DAY                

     A NURSING HOME sign on a brick wall. Suddenly the wall
     crumbles out of shot, revealing a demolition site.

     Reveal Thor and Loki wearing street clothes. Thor carries an
     umbrella, Loki is dressed in a weird avant-garde suit.

                         LOKI
               I swear, I left him right here.

                         THOR
               Right here on the sidewalk? Or
               right there, where the building
               that's being demolished? Great
               planning.

                         LOKI
               How was I supposed to know? Can't
               see into the future. I'm not a
               witch.

                         THOR
               Then why do you dress like one?

                          LOKI
               Hey.

                         THOR
               I can't believe you're alive. I saw
               you die. I mourned you, I cried for
               you.

                         LOKI
               I'm honored.

                          COLLEGE GIRL 
               Ask him.

                         COLLEGE GIRL 
               Hi. Would you mind taking a picture
               with us?
                                           .


                         THOR
               Sure.
                   (to Loki:)
               Start figuring out where he is.

                         COLLEGE GIRL 
               Oh, my god.

                         COLLEGE GIRL 
               Sorry to hear that Jane dumped you.

                         THOR
               She didn't dump me, you know.       I
               dumped her. It was a mutual
               dumping.

     Thor notices something going on around Loki.

                         THOR (CONT'D)
               What's this, what are you doing!?

     Loki looks down to see that the sidewalk has started to GLOW
     BENEATH HIM! A circle of ancient symbols.

                         LOKI
               This... isn't me.

     WHOOMPF! Loki DROPS out of sight, vanishing through solid
     concrete! Thor sees a CARD on the sidewalk where Loki was.

     Thor pokes the business card.

                         THOR
               Loki?

     He picks up the card.    It reads:

                         A Bleecker Street

     Thor picks up the card and - WHOOSH!


   EXT. SANCTUM SANTORUM - DAY                                    

     Thor approaches A Bleecker Street.

     He knocks ONCE, TWICE, and then WHOOSH!


   INT. SANCTUM SANCTORUM UPSTAIRS PARLOR - CONTINUOUS            

     Thor is suddenly inside Doctor Strange's lair!
                                        .


                    STRANGE (O.S.)
          Thor Odinson.

From a dark corner we glimpse a shape - DOCTOR STRANGE.
Levitating, he drifts towards Thor.

                    STRANGE (CONT'D)
          God of Thunder.

Thor holds up the ratty umbrella, ready to defend himself.

                    STRANGE (CONT'D)
          You can put down the umbrella.

Thor gives Strange a sideways look but then sets his umbrella
down. When he looks back up, the environment is furnished.

                    THOR
          So earth has wizards now?

                    STRANGE
          The preferred term is "Master of
          the Mystic Arts."

                    THOR
          Alright wizard, who are you?   Why
          should I care?

                    STRANGE
          My name is Doctor Stephen Strange
          and I have some questions for you.
          Take a seat.

Thor and Strange are now sitting in high-backed chairs.

                     STRANGE (CONT'D)
          Tea?

Thor now has a cup of tea in his hand.

                    THOR
          I don't drink tea.

                    STRANGE
          What do you drink?

                     THOR
          Not tea.

Thor now has a stein of beer in his hand. He drinks it
throughout the scene, but it always stays full.
                    .


          STRANGE
So I keep a watch list of
individuals and beings from other
realms that may be a threat to this
world. Your adopted brother Loki
is one of these beings.

          THOR
He's a worthy inclusion.

          STRANGE
Then why bring him here?

          THOR
We're looking for my father.

          STRANGE
So. If you were to tell you where
Odin was, all parties concerned
would promptly return to Asgard?

            THOR
Promptly.

           DR. STRANGE
Great.   Then I'll help you.

          THOR
If you knew where he was, why
didn't you call me?

           DR. STRANGE
I have to tell you, he was adamant
that he not be disturbed. Your
father said he had chosen to remain
in exile.
    (beat)
And you don't have a phone.

          THOR
No, I don't have a phone, but you
could have sent an electronic
letter. It's called an email.

          STRANGE
Yeah, do you have a computer?

           THOR
No. What for?
    (beat)
Anyway, my father is no longer in
exile. So if you could tell me
where he is, I can take him home.
                                               .


                           DR. STRANGE
                Gladly.   He's in Norway.

      Strange stands up and suddenly they are standing by a book-
      case. Strange takes down an ancient book, flips through it.

                          STRANGE
                I'm just seeing whether this
                incantation requires any Asgardian
                modifications.

      Thor reaches out to the bookcase to steady himself.

                           STRANGE (CONT'D)
                Nope.

      Suddenly they are both across the room at Strange's work
      station. Because Thor was touching the bookcase, he has
      magically brought it across the room as well.

                          STRANGE (CONT'D)
                Oh, we don't need that.

      Suddenly Thor is back across the room.   Books fall off the
      shelf and Thor's beer spills.

      He is queasy and unsteady from the teleporting.

                          THOR
                Will you stop doing that?

                          STRANGE
                I need just one strand of your
                hair.

                          THOR
                Let me explain something, my hair
                is not to be meddled wi-!

      Strange is behind Thor, he plucks a strand of hair.

      Strange extends the hair, infuses it with magic, does a few
      gestures that create a BRIGHT LIGHT and suddenly-


A0   INT. SANCTUM SANCTORUM - FRONT STAIRCASE - CONTINUOUS            A0

      Bottom of the stairs. Strange is standing. Thor is rolling
      down the stairs. A magic portal leading into a peaceful
      meadow has opened beside Strange.

                          THOR
                We could have just walked.
                                        0.


                    DR. STRANGE
              (re: the portal)
          He's waiting for you.

                       THOR
          All right.

                    STRANGE
          Don't forget your umbrella.

                       THOR
          Yes.

Thor extends his arm and holds out his hand.    Crashing noises
are heard. Lots of crashing noises.

                       THOR (CONT'D)
          Sorry

Finally the umbrella flies into his hand.

                    THOR (CONT'D)
          I suppose I'll need my brother
          back.

                    DR. STRANGE
          Yeah, right.

Suddenly we hear SCREAMING.

From above, LOKI drops out of a portal. He LANDS HARD on the
floor and then SGERS to his feet. On edge, confused.

                    LOKI
          ...I have been falling...for thirty
          minutes!

                    DR. STRANGE
              (to Thor:)
          You can handle him from here.

                    THOR
          Yeah of course.
              (they shake hands)
          Thank you very much for your help.

                       STRANGE
          Good luck.

                       LOKI
          Handle me?     Who are you?

                       THOR
          Loki.
                                                .


     Loki DRAWS a dagger, ready to attack Strange.

                          LOKI
                ..you think you're some kind of
                sorcerer? Don't think for one
                minute, you second-rate...

                            DR. STRANGE
                Bye-bye.

     Strange GESTURES with both hands and-

     -WHOOSH!   PULLS the magic portal over them.

     Just like that, Thor and Loki are gone.

0   OMITTED                                                            0

   EXT. CLIFFS - DAY                                                  

     Beautiful, undisturbed nature.       We hear the ocean nearby.

     LOKI lands on the ground, portal closes behind them.

                            THOR
                Father?

     A lone figure stands at the other side of the meadow at the
     cliff's edge, waves CRASHING below.

     It is ODIN. He's dressed plainly in humble human clothes.
     The boys approach him quickly.

                          ODIN
                Look at this place. It's beautiful.

                          THOR
                Father, it's us.

                           ODIN
                My sons.   I've been waiting for
                you.

     Loki is surprised to hear Odin call him his son.

                            THOR
                I know.    We've come to take you
                home.

                          ODIN
                Home, yes. Your mother, she calls
                me. Do you hear it?

     Thor fires a look at Loki, who holds up his hands in defense.
                                         .


                    THOR
          Loki, lift your magic.

Odin turns to Loki, who stiffens.    But Odin smiles.

                    ODIN
          Took me quite a while to break free
          from your spell. Frigga would have
          been proud.

Loki is moved by this gesture. He looks over to see Thor
staring at him, anger building.

Odin puts a hand on Thor's shoulder, calming him.

                     ODIN (CONT'D)
          Come and sit with me. I don't have
          much time.

Odin sits, out of breath, weak.    His sons sit beside him.

                    THOR
          I know that we failed you, but we
          can make this right.

                     ODIN
          I failed you.
              (beat)
          It is upon us...Ragnarok.

                    THOR
          No, I've stopped Ragnarok.    I put
          an end to Surtur.

                    ODIN
          No. It has already begun. She's
          coming. My life was all that held
          her back, but my time has come. I
          cannot keep her away any longer.

                    THOR
          Father, who are you talking about?

                    ODIN
          The Goddess of Death.     Hela.   My
          first born.
              (faces Thor)
          Your sister.

That hits Thor hard. Loki can't believe what he's hearing.

                     THOR
          ...what?
                                         .


                     ODIN
           Her violent appetites grew beyond
           my control. I couldn't stop her,
           so I imprisoned her. Locked her
           away. She draws her strength from
           Asgard...and once she gets there,
           her powers will be limitless.

                     THOR
           Whatever she is, we can stop her.
           We can face her together.

                     ODIN
               (takes Thor's hand)
           No we won't. I'm on a different
           path now. This you must face
           alone.

Odin looks into Thor's eyes, struggling to breathe.

                     ODIN (CONT'D)
           I love you my sons.

For the briefest of instances, father and sons share a quiet
moment together. Tears well in Thor's eyes.

                     ODIN (CONT'D)
           Look at that.

Ethereal sun-rays stream down upon the ocean.

                     ODIN (CONT'D)
           Remember this place. Home.

A warm glow washes over Thor's face and he turns to see that-

-ODIN IS DISSIPATING INTO STARDUST.   THE ALLFATHER HAS DIED.

A moment as the brothers separately mourn for Odin.

The sky above DARKENS and THE WIND PICKS UP.

Thor stands and turns toward Loki, his eyes burning with
rage. Loki takes a step back.

                      LOKI
           Brother.

Thor faces Loki.   Electricity CRACKLES at Thor's hands.

                     THOR
           This was your doing.

CRACK!   Behind them a black portal SPLITS OPEN!
                                          .


Thor SLAMS DOWN his umbrella, transforming into his Asgardian
armor (with Mjolnir). Loki changes into his armor as well.

A piercing scream cuts the air as a figure is hurtled out of
the portal, crashing out of this dimensional rift is HELA.

Hela takes a second to consider her surroundings.   Then:

                     HELA
          So he's gone?
              (beat)
          That's a shame. I would've liked
          to have seen that.

A tense moment as they stare each other down.

                    THOR
          You must be Hela.   I'm Thor, son of
          Odin.

                    HELA
          Really, you don't look like him.

                    LOKI
          Perhaps we can reach an
          arrangement.

                    HELA
          You sound like him.

Loki shifts nervously.   Thor's grip tightens on Mjolnir.

                    HELA (CONT'D)
          Kneel.

                    LOKI
          Beg your pardon?

Hela MANIFESTS a pitch black blade.

                    HELA
          Kneel...before your Queen.

                    THOR
          I don't think so.

Thor winds up and HURLS Mjolnir at Hela...

- THUD - the mighty hammer comes to a cold stop, against
Hela's hand.

Thor is shocked. He stretches out his hands, trying to call
Mjolnir back to him.
                                              .


     The hammer trembles in Hela's hand, like a mini game of tug-o-
     war. But ultimately Hela keeps possession.

                          THOR (CONT'D)
                It's not possible.

                          HELA
                Darling, you have no idea what's
                possible.

     HELA SHATTERS THOR'S HAMMER.

     The blast of Mjolnir's destruction sends a wave of energy
     through Thor and Loki who brace themselves against the
     impact.

     Thor is stupefied. In shock. He looks up to see Hela is
     running her hands back over her head to create the terrifying
     battle headdress.

     Loki's reaction is more panic.   He stands and calls up:

                          LOKI
                Bring us back!

                          THOR
                No!!

     Hela CHARGES Thor and Loki as-

     -WHOOSH!   The Bi-Frost envelopes all of them.


   INT. BI-FROST - CONTINUOUS                                       

     Thor and Loki ZOOM UPWARDS, held inside this celestial beam
     warping them towards Asgard. Loki and Thor look down to
     see... Hela is in the Bi-Frost, behind them and CATCHING UP.

     Loki turns and throws TWO DAGGERS at her. They find their
     mark, stalling her for a second. But she PLOWS RIGHT THROUGH
     Loki, KNOCKING HIM OUT OF THE BI-FROST. Gone in an instant.

                          THOR
                Loki!

     Hela projects a jet black grappling hook and GRABS HOLD of
     Thor. Drawing him to her, preparing to finish him off. Thor
     pulls up his legs, and KICKS Hela with both feet. This
     effectively dislodges him from her grasp but also...

     ...KNOCKS THOR OUT OF THE BI-FROST! Now both he and Loki are
     gone. If they aren't dead, then God knows where they went.
                                             .


   INT. THE OBSERVATORY - CONTINUOUS                               

     VOLSG has a grip on Heimdall's sword, manning Bi-Frost's
     controls. Behind him FANDRAL is overseeing Skurge, who is
     mopping up the dragon guts.

     BOOM! Hela emerges with thunderous impact. Fandral and
     Volsg draw their weapons, preparing to engage.

                          VOLSG
               Who are you!? What have you done
               with Thor?

     Hela fires TWO BLACK DAGGERS, each one dropping its target to
     the ground. Hela then walks forward and-

                           HELA
               I'm Hela.

     -BRUTALLY KILLS FANDRAL AND VOLSG!

     Hela sees Skurge. Approaches calmly, a vision of death.

     With Hela only a few feet from him, Skurge cowers.   Pause.

                         SKURGE
               I'm just a janitor.

     Skurge ever-so-slightly peers up at her.

                         HELA
               You look like a smart boy with good
               survival instincts. How would you
               like a job?

     Hela looks out upon Asgard as Skurge rises behind her.


   EXT. ASGARD - THE MOUNTAINS - SAME                              

     A mysterious HOODED FIGURE watches Hela's arrival at the
     Observatory and begins a steady descent towards the city.


   EXT. SAKAAR - THE WASTELAND SHORE - DAY                         

     SUPER WIDE: A sky full of WORMHOLES. Thor, only a spec at
     this distance, SHOOTS out of one of these wormholes. He HITS
     the surface, causing a CLOUD of dust.

     Find Thor on his back surrounded by strange colorful space
     wreckage. Looking up, Thor sees a large metal object falling
     from a different wormhole! He rolls out of the way. THUD!
                                            .


Thor runs up a dune to get away from the shower of debris.

Thor reaches the top of the dune and finds himself looking
down on A BEACH in a strange WASTELAND. Camera scans a filthy
dune littered with SPACE JUNK.

Out across the OCEAN he notices A NIGHTMARE WORMHOLE - a
giant open cylinder of whirling smoke and lightning storms.

A loud noise draws Thor's attention to a HUGE RECTANGULAR
"SCRAPPER" SHIP hauling a crashed SPACE VESSEL out of the
water. Beneath the ship are various SCRAPPERS, masked
humanoids. The ship is BLASTING WEIRD ALIEN MUSIC.

A Scrapper notices Thor, then signals to his crew.

                    LEAD SCRAPPER
          Are you a fighter or are you food?

                    THOR
          I'm just passing through.

                    LEAD SCRAPPER
          It is food. On your knees.

Thor reaches out to summon Mjolnir.    A reflex.   Nothing.

The LEAD SCRAPPER levels a MAGNO-RIFLE at Thor and WHAP! A
solid metal projectile KNOCKS Thor flat on his back. More
Scrappers attack, throwing nets and firing more projectiles.
Thor tries to swat them away but they keep coming. The rest
of the scrappers move in with iron bats and clubs.

WHOOSH! A second ship arrives, landing nearby. It's cool,
sleek, and dangerous, deserving of its name: WARSONG. It is
also BLASTING DIFFERENT WEIRD ALIEN MUSIC.

The FRONT of Warsong FLIPS OPEN and a GANGPLANK extends down
to the ground. The scrappers stop and stare as we TRACK IN to
a HERO REVEAL of SCRAPPER # (S for short) - a beautiful
and ruthless asskicker.

S lifts a half-empty bottle to her lips and CHUGS it. She
finishes the bottle and smashes it on the side of her ship.

                       SCRAPPER #
          He's MINE.

She walks down the gangplank... before veering off course and
FALLING straight off into a pile of TRASH. She's PLASTERED.

The Scrappers shrug and start hauling Thor away.
                                         .


                       SCRAPPER # (CONT'D)
          Wait!

S sgers to her feet, takes a deep breath. She holds on
to a piece of junk as support - some dead beast. Thor
continues to struggle with his captors, tangled in nets.

                    SCRAPPER # (CONT'D)
          Wait! He's mine. So if you want
          him, you go through me.

The Scrappers start brandishing their weapons.

                    SCRAPPER
          But we've already got him.

S CLANGS her metal gauntlets together which activate.

                    SCRAPPER #
          Alright then I guess I go through
          you.

                       LEAD SCRAPPER
          More food.

She holds out her fists as if she's operating machinery...

...Warsong WHIRS to life. S clenches her fists and we hear
a horrible SCREECHING NOISE as Warsong OPENS FIRE.

She sweeps her arms out in an arc, the spray of gunfire
lasting THREE SECONDS. She bangs her fists again, sending the
ship into IDLE MODE. The Scrappers are now little more than
tiny pieces of litter covering the beach.

Thor is fixated on this beautiful murderer approaching. One
final HUGE Scrapper comes at her with a bat. S casually
GRABS this Scrapper and HURLS him up into the air behind her.

                       THOR
          Thank you.

From her belt S FLICKS a small glowing disc which LODGES
into Thor's NECK. Far in the background, the Scrapper she
threw finally HITS the ground with a loud THUD.

She holds up a fob device and presses the button - the disc
blinks and Thor is filled with the pain of a thousand
screaming squirrels. He hits the ground, stunned.

S DRAGS Thor towards her ship.
                                              .

     Thor's face SMUSHED up against glass.   His eyes are open.

     Thor's POV - THE CAPITAL - an eclectic city composed of
     salvaged items from all over the universe.

     Thor is lying in a sort of small GLASS HOLDING CELL beneath
     Warsong's COCKPIT. He looks up to see S piloting the ship.

     Thor's eyes lock in on her belt, specifically the fob device
     she used to activate the Obedience Disk/debilitate him.

                         SCRAPPER #
               This is Scrapper . I need
               clearance and an audience with the
               boss. I've got something special.

                          THOR
               Hey!   Where are you taking me?

     S ignores him, takes a swig from the bottle, and then
     nonchalantly UNCLIPS the fob from her belt.

                         THOR (CONT'D)
               Answer me! Hey! I am Thor, son of
               Odin. I need to get back to
               Asgard.

                         SCRAPPER #
               Many apologies, your majesty.

     S ZAPS him and guides her ship towards a COLOSSAL TOWER.


   EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF ASGARD - DAY                                   

     CLOSE ON: Hela, headdress retracted, hair down, her beautiful
     face fully visible. We do not see who she is talking to.

                         HELA
               It's come to my attention that you
               don't know who I am.

     REVEAL THE ARMIES OF ASGARD FACING DOWN HELA.

     Standing in front is HOGUN, sword and shield out.

                         HELA (CONT'D)
               I am Hela, Odin's first born,
               Commander of the legions of Asgard,
               the rightful heir to the throne,
               and the Goddess of Death.

                         HELA (CONT'D)
               My father is dead. As are the
               princes. You're welcome.
                   (then:)
               We were once the seat of absolute
               power in the Cosmos. Our supremacy
               was unchallenged, yet Odin stopped
               at Nine Realms. Our destiny is to
               rule over all others. And I am
               here to restore that power. Kneel
               before me...and rise into the ranks
               of my great conquest.

     THE E-GUARDS GET INTO ATTACK FORMATION.

                         HOGUN
               Whoever you are... whatever you've
               done, surrender now! Or we will
               show you know mercy.

                         HELA
               Whoever I am? Did you listen to a
               word I said?

                         HOGUN
               This is your last warning!

                         HELA
               I thought you'd be happy to see me.

     Hela forms her headdress.

                         HELA (CONT'D)
               Fine.

     The Asgardian archers LOOSE DOZENS OF ARROWS, but-

     -Hela advances confidently, DESTROYS the SHIPS and SOARS INTO
     THE EINHERJAR! In a symphony of spectacular terror, Hela
     proceeds to DECIMATE the entire regiment. A tornado of
     carnage, a legendary massacre.


   EXT. BELOW THE RAINBOW BRIDGE - SAME                            

     While Hela slaughters up above, we tilt up from a boat,
     moored at the base of the Observatory, to see the mysterious
     figure from earlier is now SCALING the rocks towards the top.


   INT. THE OBSERVATORY - CONTINUOUS                               

     Now silhouetted in the entrance way, the figure scans the
     Observatory. His gaze falls on-
                                               .


      -Bi-Frost's controls. Specifically Heimdall's sword.


    EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF ASGARD - CONTINUOUS                            

      It's eerily quiet. CLOSE on Hela scanning the battlefield.
      00+ slain Einherjar at her feet.

      ANGLE on Skurge as he steps forward - awe, admiration, fear.

                          HELA
                Oh, I've missed this. Still, it's
                a shame. Good soldiers dying for
                nothing...all because they couldn't
                see the future. Sad.
                    (then she sees:)
                Oh! Look, still alive.

      Reveal Hogun, severely injured but sgering to his feet,
      resilient.

                          HELA (CONT'D)
                Change of heart?

      Hogun draws a dagger as a last ditch attack.

                          HOGUN
                Go back to whatever cave you crept
                out of you evil demoness!

      Hela IMPALES Hogun on a spike.   She turns to Skurge.

                          HELA
                Let's go see my palace.

      Skurge stares at Hogun before following Hela towards the
      palace.

A   INT. DARK TUNNEL - DAY                                           A

      THOR, strapped to the chair, suddenly finds himself slowly
      moving forward. After a beat-

      -the walls LIGHT UP and a SOOTHING VOICE speaks to him.

                          SOOTHING VOICE (V.O.)
                Fear not, for you are found. You
                are home, and there is no going
                back. No one leaves this place.

      Thor STRUGGLES against his restraints.
                                        .


                     SOOTHING VOICE (V.O.)
          But what is this place? The answer
          in Sakaar.

The tunnel walls show images of Sakaar's place in the Cosmos.

                    SOOTHING VOICE (V.O.)
          Surrounded by cosmic gateways,
          Sakaar lives on the edge of the
          known and unknown.

Images of the wormholes that cover Sakaar's atmosphere.

                    SOOTHING VOICE (V.O.)
          It is the collection point for all
          lost and unloved things. Like you.
          But here on Sakaar, you are
          significant. You are valuable.
          Here, you are loved.

                    THOR
          What...the hell?

                    SOOTHING VOICE (V.O.)
          And no one loves you more than the
          Grandmaster.

Images of the Grandmaster, in silhouette, arriving on Sakaar.

                    SOOTHING VOICE (V.O.)
          He is the original. The first
          lost, and the first found. The
          creator of Sakaar and the father of
          the Contest of Champions.

Images of the arena where aliens battle to the death.

                    SOOTHING VOICE (V.O.)
          Where once you were nothing, now
          you are something. You are the
          property of the Grandmaster.
              (then:)
          Congratulations! You will meet the
          Grandmaster in five seconds.

Images around the tunnel begin speeding up. Chaos, violence,
and confusion mixed in with Grandmaster's face.

Thor, already bewildered, looks on the verge of panic.

                    SOOTHING VOICE (V.O.)
          Prepare yourself. Prepare
          yourself. You are now meeting the
          Grandmaster.

     Thor SCREAMS!


   INT. GRANDMASTER'S CHAMBERS - CONTINUOUS                        

     Suddenly Thor is somewhere else, surrounded weirdos and
     insanely dressed palace guards.

     His scream dies down self-consciously.

     A musical beat PLAYS in the background.

     THE GRANDMASTER, a tall mysterious man in golden robes. He is
     looking right at us. He doesn't know what to make of us. He's
     curious, thrilled, revolted, and titillated.

     Pulling back we see TOPAZ, his trusty guard, at his side. Two
     GOLDEN LADIES loiter off to the side. Other strange guests
     can be seen in the background. Grandmaster just stares.

     S stands beside Grandmaster.    Finally:

                         GRANDMASTER
               He's wonderful.
                   (then:)
               It is a he?

     Reveal S standing beside Thor.

                            SCRAPPER #
               It's a he.

                         GRANDMASTER
               Yeah. I love when you come to visit
               , you bring me the best stuff.
                   (to Topaz:)
               Whenever we get to talking, Topaz,
               about Scrapper ...what do I
               always say? "She is the..." and it
               starts with a B.

                            TOPAZ
               Trash.

                         GRANDMASTER
               No, not trash. Were you waiting
               just to call her that? It doesn't
               start with a "B."

                            TOPAZ
               Booze hag.
                                           .


                    GRANDMASTER
          I'm so sorry. No, "best." I was
          thinking about "best."
              (to S:)
          Because I always say you're the
          best. She brought me my precious
          beloved Champion, you know.

                    TOPAZ
          You say that every time she's here.

                    GRANDMASTER
          What have you brought today?    Tell
          me.

                    SCRAPPER #
          A contender.

                     THOR
          A what?

                    GRANDMASTER
          I need to go closer. I want a
          closer look at this. Can you take
          us closer? Thank you.

Grandmaster advances on Thor.    Examining him closely and
strangely. Then:

                    GRANDMASTER (CONT'D)
          Pay this lady.

                    THOR
          Just wait a damn minute.    I'm not
          for sale.

Using all his might, Thor breaks out of his shackles, but-

-S ZAPS him again.    Paralyzed by superheated veins.

                     GRANDMASTER
          Man.   He is a fighter.

                    SCRAPPER #
          I'd take 0 million.

                    TOPAZ
          Tell her she's dreaming.

                    GRANDMASTER
          For heaven's sake, transfer the
          units.
                                         .


Topaz transfers S the units. Without sympathy or ceremony,
S exits.

                    THOR
          You'll pay for this!

                    SCRAPPER #
          No, I got paid for this.

Thor claws at the obedience disk, trying to RIP IT OUT.

He gets some separation from his skin, but the disk is
causing him even more pain. Thor eventually has to let go.
Grandmaster holds up HIS OWN fob device and uses it like a
wand to guide Thor's HOVER CHAIR, which follows Grandmaster
around as he speaks.

                    GRANDMASTER
          Here's what I wanna know.    Who are
          you?

                    THOR
          I am the God of THUNDER!!!

Thor THRUSTS his arms into the air but only a tiny bit of
static electricity POPS within Thor's hands.

                    GRANDMASTER
          Wow. I didn't hear any thunder,
          but out of your fingers, was that
          like...sparkles?

                    TOPAZ
          We located your cousin.

                     GRANDMASTER
          Oh good!
              (to Thor:)
          Yeah, come on. I think you're gonna
          like this.

Grandmaster moves Thor's chair to another section where-

-COUSIN CARLO is waiting. He's strapped to a chair like
Thor, and he is terrified.

                    GRANDMASTER (CONT'D)
          There he is. Hey, cuz. We almost
          couldn't find you. What, have you
          been hiding?

Cousin Carlo looks at Thor, cowering in fear.
                                           .


                       THOR
          Hi.

Carlo only further weeps.

                       GRANDMASTER
          So...

                     COUSIN CARLO
          Please.   I'm sorry.

                    GRANDMASTER
          Carlo... I pardon you.

                       COUSIN CARLO
          Thank you.     Thank you.

                    GRANDMASTER
          You're officially pardoned...from
          life.

Grandmaster casually takes Topaz's Sakaarian Guard staff and
JABS it into his cousin's mid-section-

-CAUSING ALL OF HIS FLESH TO MELT OFF HIS SKELETON!

Carlo SHRIEKS IN PAIN before his vocal cords melt.    Thor
looks on, in shock.

                    THOR
          Oh, my god!

Liquid Carlo spreads towards Grandmaster.

                    GRANDMASTER
          I'm stepping in it. I'm stepping
          in it. Look out!

                    THOR
              (repulsed)
          Oh, the smell.

                    GRANDMASTER
          What does it smell like?

                    TOPAZ
          Burnt toast.

                    GRANDMASTER
          What happened to my manners? I
          haven't properly introduced myself.
          Come on. Follow me.

Grandmaster gives Topaz back her staff.
                                        .


Grandmaster and Thor arrive at a space where A GROUP OF
MUSICIANS PLAY STRANGE INSTRUMENTS (the source of the music
thus far). Grandmaster joins them, still speaking to Thor.

Grandmaster begins PLAYING a strange piano-like contraption,
riffing a melody over the existing music.

                    GRANDMASTER (CONT'D)
          My name is Grandmaster. I preside
          over a little harlequinade called
          the Contest of Champions. People
          come from far and wide to
          unwillingly participate in it. And
          you, my friend, might just be part
          of the new cast. What do you say
          to that?

                    THOR
          We're not friends, and I don't give
          a shit about your games! I'm going
          back to Asgard!

                    GRANDMASTER
              (amused)
          Ass-gard?
              (then:)
          One, two, three, four.

Grandmaster really gets into his PLAYING. Grandmaster's
guards and VIP guests start MOVING TO THE MUSIC.

Thor takes a moment to look around at this bizarre spectacle
unfolding around him. In doing so, he zeroes in on one
particular group of VIPS, specifically...

...LOKI! He's lounging and dressed in Sakaarian garb.

                    LOKI
          There was a wormhole in space and
          time beneath me. At that moment, I
          let go.

                    THOR
          Loki!? Loki! Over here!

Loki notices Thor. Blanches a little. Sidles closer so as
to speak to Thor without looking like he's speaking to Thor.

                    LOKI
          Excuse me one second.

                    THOR
          Loki!
                             .


Loki hustles over to Thor, SHUSHING him.

                     LOKI
          What?   You're alive?

                    THOR
          Yes, of course I'm alive.

                    LOKI
          What are you doing here?

                    THOR
          What do you mean, what am I doing?
          I'm stuck in this stupid chair.
          Where's your chair?

                    LOKI
          I didn't get a chair.

                    THOR
          Get me out of this one.

                       LOKI
          I can't.

                       THOR
          What?

                    LOKI
          I've made friends with this man.
          He's called the Grandmaster.

                    THOR
          Oh, he's crazy!

                    LOKI
          I've gained his favor.. The Bi-
          Frost brought me out here weeks
          ago.

                       THOR
          Weeks ago?     I just got here.

Suddenly Grandmaster is right next to them.

                    GRANDMASTER
          What are you whispering about?

Both Thor and Loki react, startled.

                    GRANDMASTER (CONT'D)
          Time works real different around
          these parts.

                    GRANDMASTER (CONT'D)
          On any other world, I'd be like,
          millions of years old. But here on
          Sakaar...

Grandmaster beholds himself.   Then turns to Loki.   A truly
uncomfortable silence.

                    GRANDMASTER (CONT'D)
          In any case, you know this... You
          call yourself Lord of Thunder?

                    THOR
          God of Thunder.    Tell him.

                    LOKI
          I've never met this man in my life.

                    THOR
          He's my brother.

                     LOKI
          Adopted.

                    GRANDMASTER
          Is he any kind of a fighter?

Loki shrugs, gives the universal gesture for "so-so."

                    THOR
          You take this thing out of my neck
          and I'll show you.

                    GRANDMASTER
          Now listen to that. He's
          threatening me. Hey, Sparkles,
          here's the deal. If you wanna get
          back to Ass-place, Assberg...

                     THOR
          Asgard.

                    GRANDMASTER
          Any contender who defeats my
          champion, their freedom they shall
          win.

                    THOR
          Fine. Then point me in the
          direction of whoever's ass I have
          to kick.

                    GRANDMASTER
          That's what I call, contender!
          Direction would be this way, Lord.
                                             0.


                            THOR
               Loki!

     Guards arrive.    They haul Thor up and escort him out.

   INT. THE ARENA - GLADIATOR CELLS - NIGHT                        

     Thor is shoved into a spacious cell where other alien
     prisoners are lurking in the back.

     The thick cell door SLAMS SHUT behind Thor. Thor gets up and
     immediately begins THROWING his shoulder into the door. The
     door doesn't budge, not even a little.

     Behind him, KORG, a hulking Kronan rock alien, speaks up.

                         KORG
               Hey! Take it easy man!
                   (Thor looks back)
               Over here. The pile of rocks
               waving at you. Yeah I'm actually a
               thing, I'm a being. Allow me to
               introduce myself, my name is Korg.
               I'm kind of like the leader in
               here. I'm made of rocks, as you
               can see, but don't let that
               intimidate you. You don't need to
               be afraid unless you're made of
               scissors.
                   (GIGGLES to himself)
               Just a little rock-paper-scissor
               joke for you. This is my very good
               friend over here, Miek. He's an
               insect and has knives for hands.

     MIEK, a slug alien inside a robot exoskeleton, says hello by
     doing some karate moves.

                         THOR
               You're a Kronan, aren't you?

                            KORG
               That I am.

                         THOR
               How'd you end up in here?

                         KORG
               Well, I tried to start a revolution
               but didn't print enough pamphlets,
               so hardly anyone turned up.

          Except for my mom and her
          boyfriiend, who I hate. As
          punishment, I was forced to be in
          here and become a gladiator. Bit
          of a promotional disaster.
              (secretive)
          But I'm actually organizing another
          revolution. I don't know if you'd
          be interested in something like
          that. Do you reckon you'd be
          interested?

Thor tries to run ahead down the circle and loops back around
behind Korg.

                    THOR
          How did you...

                    KORG
          Yeah, no. This whole thing is a
          circle. But not a real circle,
          more like a freaky circle.

                    THOR
          This doesn't make any sense.

                    KORG
          No, nothing makes sense here. The
          only thing that does make sense, is
          that nothing makes sense.

                    THOR
          Has anyone here fought the
          Grandmaster's Champion?

                    KORG
          Doug has. Doug!
              (realizes)
          Oh, right, Doug's dead. That's
          right. Everyone who fights the
          Grandmaster's champion perishes.

                    THOR
          What about you? You're made of
          rocks.

                    KORG
          Perishable rocks.
              (a pebble FALLS OFF)
          There you go. Another one gone.
          Yeah, no, I just do the smaller
          fights, warm up the crowd and
          whatnot. Wait. You're not gonna
          face him, are you?
                                                .


                            THOR
                  Yes I am. Fight him, win, and get
                  the hell out of this place.

                            KORG
                  That's exactly what Doug used to
                  say. See you later, new Doug.

      Korg walks away and approaches Miek.


A   EXT. ASGARD - STREETS - SUNSET                                    A

      The streets of Asgard are cold and silent, save for the
      occasional distant sounds and screams of a city under siege.

      Moving down the throne room corridor we see-

      -SEVERAL DEAD EINHERJAR GUARDS.

      One guy is still alive, desperately trying to crawl away.

      SHLNK!    A black blade finishes him off.

      Reveal HELA and SKURGE looking down at the carnage.

      Hela directs her attention to FRESCOS ON THE CEILING. Like
      the Sistine Chapel, except these depict Asgard's shining
      influence on the Nine Realms. Bountiful harvests, shepherds
      with full flocks, common folk throwing parades for Asgard's
      army, etc.

                            HELA
                  Does no one remember me?
                      (awaiting an answer)
                  Has no one been taught our history?
                  Look at these lies. Goblets and
                  garden parties? Peace treaties?

      Hela leads them towards the throne.

                            HELA (CONT'D)
                  Odin... proud to have it... ashamed
                  of how he got it.

      Hela FIRES SPIKES into the ceiling, RIPPING DOWN plaster.

      Beneath the surface are older Frescos.      These ones are far
      more dark and sinister.
                                             .


      Soldiers in battle. Blood. A giant war wolf.     Young Odin
      and young Hela. Slaves building the palace.

      Skurge is at least somewhat disturbed by this.

                           HELA (CONT'D)
                We were unstoppable. I was his
                weapon in the conquest that built
                Asgard's empire. One by one, the
                realms became ours.

      Hela turns from the murals to address Skurge.

                          HELA (CONT'D)
                But then, simply because my
                ambition outgrew his...he banished
                me, caged me, locked me away like
                an animal. Before that, Asgard's
                warriors were honored, their bodies
                buried as heroes beneath this very
                place.

      Hela beckons Skurge to follow her.


B   INT. ODIN'S VAULT - CONTINUOUS                                  B

      Hela enters the vault and descends the stairs towards the
      magical items.

                          SKURGE
                Odin's treasures.

      SKURGE follows her. Hela walks towards the Infinity Gauntlet.

                             HELA
                Fake.

      Hela KNOCKS the gauntlet off its pedestal.

                          HELA (CONT'D)
                Most of the stuff in here is fake.

      Next: The Casket of Ancient Winter.

                             HELA (CONT'D)
                Or weak.

      Next: Surtur's skull.

                          HELA (CONT'D)
                Smaller than I thought it would be.

      Next: The Tesseract.    She hesitates:
                                               .


                          HELA (CONT'D)
                That's not bad?
                    (notices:)
                But this... The Eternal Flame.

      THE ETERNAL FLAME flickers in its chalice.

      Hela DIGS HER HAND INTO THE ETERNAL FLAME. She pulls her
      hand out now cupping GREEN FIRE, like a torch.

      Hela approaches a large circular RUNE ETCHING on the floor.

      Hela manifests a huge CLAW HAMMER. She SMASHES THROUGH THE
      RUNES ON THE FLOOR, creating a gaping chasm.

      She looks at Skurge.

                          HELA (CONT'D)
                Want to see what true power looks
                like?

      Hela looks down into the darkness below.

      With her hand aflame, Hela JUMPS down into the chasm!


C   INT. HIDDEN ASGARDIAN CATACOMBS - DAY                            C

      Hela LANDS like a bad ass.

      Dust settles. The light of Hela's hand torch reveals a stone
      crypt. An ornate burial place for the heroes of Old Asgard.

      We can see countless rotted skeletons in badass ancient
      Asgardian armor. Hela's regiment.

      Among them, A MASSIVE WOLF'S SKELETON. TERRIFYING AND
      MONSTROUS, COLOSSAL CHAINS AROUND THE BONES OF ITS PAWS.
      FENRIS.

      Hela approaches Fenris' skeleton.

                          HELA
                Fenris. My darling, what have they
                done to you?

      She lifts her flaming hand above her head. She slams her hand
      into the ground.

                          HELA (CONT'D)
                With the Eternal Flame, you are
                reborn!

      The fire spreads out, covering Fenris and Hela's old army.
                                               .


       As the fire covers the skeletons, they SHUDDER TO LIFE.

                            HELA (CONT'D)
                  I've missed you. I've missed you
                  all.

       HELA'S BUTCHERS, rise up before their commander.

       ABOVE:   Skurge looks down, worried.

       BELOW: A sinister light returns to Fenris's eyes as he
       stands proudly before his master, allowing her to pet the fur
       of his terrifying face.

       Thor sits against the wall.   Quietly praying.

       -for those that have died the    -for those that have died the
       glorious death.                  glorious death.

       Reveal Loki standing across the cell.   Thor gives him a hard
       look.

                            LOKI (CONT'D)
                  It hurts, doesn't it? Being lied
                  to. Being told you're one thing and
                  then learning it's all a fiction.

       Thor picks up some stones that have fallen from Korg's leg
       and casually starts throwing them through Loki's illusion.

                            LOKI (CONT'D)
                  You didn't think I'd really come
                  and see you, did you? This place
                  is disgusting.

       Thor throws another stone through Loki.

                            LOKI (CONT'D)
                  Does this mean you don't want my
                  help?

       Thor throws another stone through Loki.
                                          .


                    LOKI (CONT'D)
          Look, I couldn't jeopardize my
          position with Grandmaster, it took
          me time to win his trust. He's a
          lunatic, but he can be amenable.

Thor throws another stone through Loki.    Disinterested.

                    LOKI (CONT'D)
          What I'm telling you is, you could
          join me at the Grandmaster's side.
          Perhaps, in time, an accident
          befalls the Grandmaster, and
          then...

Loki gestures: "we take over."

Thor throws another stone through Loki.    Bored.

                    LOKI (CONT'D)
          You're not seriously thinking of
          going back, are you? Our sister
          destroyed your hammer like a piece
          of glass. She's stronger than both
          of us. She's stronger than you.
          You don't stand a chance. Do you
          understand what I'm saying to you?

Thor just scowls.

                    LOKI (CONT'D)
          Fine. I guess I'll just have to go
          it alone. Like I've always done.
              (Thor smirks)
          Would you say something?

Now out of stones, Thor looks around the floor for more.

                    LOKI (CONT'D)
          Say something!

Thor finally looks right at Loki, speaks fast and curt:

                    THOR
          What would you like me to say? You
          faked your own death, you stole the
          throne, stripped Odin of his power,
          stranded him on Earth...
              (on Loki:)
          -to die, releasing the Goddess of
          Death.

               Have I said enough, or do you do
               you want me to go further back than
               the past two days?

     Loki's eyes burn.   Thor stares coldly at him.   Loki tries to
     compose himself.

                         LOKI
               You know, I haven't seen this
               Beloved Champion he talks of, but
               I've heard he's astonishingly
               savage. I've placed a large wager
               against you tomorrow. Don't let me
               down.

     Loki SHIMMERS, and his illusion vanishes.   Korg runs in to
     try to kick him.

                         KORG
               Piss off, ghost!
                   (then:)
               He's freaking gone.


0   INT. THE ARENA - RECEIVING AREA                                  0

     Thor, Korg, and a gaggle of other prisoners/fighters have
     been led from their cells to a PRE-FIGHT HOLDING AREA.

     Korg and Thor are by the weapons rack.

                         KORG
               Yuck! There's Still someone's hair
               and blood all over this. Guys, can
               you clean up the weapons once you
               finish your fight? Disgusting
               slobs.
                   (then:)
               Thor...wanna use a big wooden fork?

                          THOR
               No.

                         KORG
               Yeah, not really useful unless
               you're fighting off three vampires
               that were huddled together.

                         THOR
               I really wish I had my hammer.

                          KORG
               Hammer?
                                        .


                    THOR
          Quite unique. It was made from
          this special metal from the heart
          of a dying star. And when I spun
          it really, really fast it gave me
          the ability to fly.

                    KORG
          You rode a hammer?

                    THOR
          No, I didn't ride the hammer.

                    KORG
          The hammer rode you on your back?

                    THOR
          No. I used to spin it really fast,
          and it would pull me off the...

                       KORG
          Oh my God.     The hammer pulled you
          off?

                    THOR
          The ground. It would pull me off
          the ground, up into the air, and I
          would fly. Every time I threw it,
          it would always come back to me.

                     KORG
          Sounds like you had a pretty
          special and intimate relationship
          wiht this hammer and that losing it
          was almost comparable to losing a
          loved one.

                    THOR
          That's a nice way of putting it.

Thor spots S dealing at the bar.    He's once again eyeing
the fob device clipped to her belt.    Scowls.

                    SCRAPPER #
          I said they're mine.

                    THOR
          See her, the one that put me in
          here.

                    KORG
          Yeah, Scrapper . She's strong.
          And she drinks a lot.
                    (MORE)
                                      .

                    KORG (CONT'D)
          Gotta watch out for those
          Asgardians, man. They are hard to
          perish.

                        THOR
          Asgardian?

Thor breaks away from the line and runs to S.

                        THOR (CONT'D)
          Hey!   Hey!

S holds up the fob.

                    THOR (CONT'D)
          Do not zap me with that thing. I
          just wanna talk. Asgard is in
          danger.

Thor then notices a series of PATTERNED SCARS, or BRANDS, on
her forearms. It's a moment of recognition and disbelief.

                    THOR (CONT'D)
          My God, you're a Valkyrie. I used
          to wanna be a Valkyrie when I was
          younger...until I found out that
          you were all women. There's
          nothing wrong with women, of
          course. I love women. Sometimes a
          little too much. Not in a creepy
          way, just more of a respectful
          appreciation. I think it's great
          that there is an elite force of
          women warriors. It's about time.

                    SCRAPPER #
          Are you done?

                    WARDEN (O.S.)
          Lord of Thunder, you're up.

                    THOR
          Please, help me.     I need your help.

                        SCRAPPER #
          Bye.

                    THOR
          Fine, then you must be a traitor or
          a coward because the Valkyrie are
          sworn to protect the throne.

S finally turns her attention to Thor, intense.
                                             0.


                          SCRAPPER #
                Listen closely, your majesty. This
                is Sakaar, not Asgard. And I'm a
                scrapper, not a Valkyrie.

      Guards swarm Thor, dragging him back

                          WARDEN (O.S.)
                Bring him in for processing!

                          VALKYRIE
                And no one escapes this place. So
                you're gonna die anyway.

      Despite her denial, Thor has clearly hit a nerve. And from
      now on we will refer to Scrapper # as VALKYRIE.

      Valkyrie takes her booze and walks away. Thor is dragged
      away, passing Korg and the other prisoners.


0A   INT. PROCESSING ROOM - DAY                                        0A

      Thor is strapped to a chair. Reveal a weird alien BARBER
      (Stan Lee cameo) holding up some rusty shears.

                          STAN LEE
                Now, don't you move. My hands
                ain't as steady as they used to be.

                          THOR
                By Odin's beard, you shall not cut
                my hair... lest you feel the wrath
                of the might Thor.

      Barber activates a menacing CUTTING TOOL.   Thor freaks out.

                          THOR (CONT'D)
                Please. Please, kind sir, do not
                cut my hair! No!


0B   INT. THE ARENA - NIGHT                                            0B

      Hundreds of thousands of spectators packed into the stadium
      seats. Dozens of starships are parked above the arena.

      Find THE GRANDMASTER'S LUXURY SUITE, a VIP box attached to
      the fighting area. The Golden Ladies are in attendance.

      Loki lounges in the suite, taking wagers on the fight card.

      Grandmaster walks out into the center of the arena.   Suddenly-
                                         .


-THE GRANDMASTER GROWS TO 0-FEET TALL! This enlarged
projection of Grandmaster addresses the audience.

                    GRANDMASTER
          Wow! Look at all of you. What a
          show, WHAT-A-NIGHT! Who's having
          fun? Please, I'm your host. Big
          round of applause for all of our
          undercard competitors... who died
          so gruesomely. Good sports. What a
          show! What a night! This is what
          you've come for and so have I.
              (applause)
          And now, without further ado...
          it's main event time!!
              (INSANE APPLAUSE)
          Making his first appearance, though
          he looks quite promising, got a
          couple of tricks up his sleeve.
          I'll say no more, see what you
          think. Ladies and gentlemen...
              (LAUGHTER from the crowd)
          I give to you...Lord of Thunder!

Enter Thor. Gladiator Thor. Shaved head, trimmed beard,
minimalist armor, covered in weapons. Two swords on his
back, giant mace in one hand, spiked shield in the other.

                    GRANDMASTER (CONT'D)
          Watch out for his fingers. They
          make sparks.

Thor looks up at the throngs of SCREAMING FANS. And then...

...puts on his helmet. A badass gladiator variation of his
classic winged helm. Thor is ready to rumble.

ABOVE: Find Valkyrie in her Warsong ship, parked amongst the
other tailgaters. She POPS open a bottle of booze. Drinks.

                    GRANDMASTER (CONT'D)
          Okay, this is it. Let's get ready
          to welcome this guy. Here he comes.
          He is a creature. What can we say
          about him? Well, he's unique.
          There's none like him. I feel a
          special connection with him.

Suddenly the floor beneath Thor's feet LOWERS.   A slow,
tension-building GRIND as he sees-

-A DOOR across the arena.   Bigger and bigger.
                                        .


The entire crowd is on its feet. Palpable anticipation.    The
spotlights change to bright stadium lights.

                     GRANDMASTER (CONT'D)
           He's undefeated. HE'S THE
           REIGNING...HE'S THE DEFENDING...
           Ladies and gentlemen... I give
           you...

KA-BOOM!   EXPLODING through a door is the Champion...

...THE INCREDIBLE HULK! He wears an armored shoulder guard
and a Spartan helmet. He carries a warhammer in one hand and
a battleaxe in the other. Hulk POUNDS his chest and ROARS,
further energizing an already frenzied crowd.

Meanwhile, the sight of Hulk makes Thor's arms drop to his
sides along with his jaw dropping to the ground. And then-

-Thor LAUGHS his ass off. Like, "that's my buddy over there!"

                     THOR
           Yes!

IN THE VIP BOX: Loki goes ghost white. Traumatic memories of
being Hulk-smashed flood his brain. Gone is all his joy.

                     LOKI
           I have to get off this planet.

Loki tries to exit, but the Grandmaster stops him.

                     GRANDMASTER
           Hey, hey, hey! Where are you going?

Grandmaster plops Loki down in the front row, right against
the glass. Loki casually tries to hide his face in his hand.

IN THE ARENA:

                     THOR
           Hey! We know each other. He's a
           friend from work.
               (to Hulk:)
           Where have you been? Everybody
           thought you were dead. So much has
           happened since I last saw you. I
           lost my hammer. Like, yesterday,
           so that's still pretty fresh.
               (then:)
           Loki! Loki's alive. Can you
           believe it? He's up there.
               (waves to Loki:)
           Loki! Look who it is!
                                       .


Loki is petrified.

                    THOR (CONT'D)
          Banner, I never thought I would say
          this, but I'm happy to see you.

IN THE ARENA: Hulk is still eyeballing Thor while the
capacity crowd CHANTS insanely for "HULK! HULK! HULK!"

                      THOR (CONT'D)
          Banner.    Hey, Banner!

Hulk's face grimaces and contorts, suppressing puny Banner.

                       HULK
          NO BANNER!     ONLY HULK!

Hulk CHARGES at Thor.    Insanely fast.

                    THOR
          What are you doing?    It's me.

Thor DODGES the first few attacks, but then Hulk SHATTERS his
shield and sends Thor FLYING.

Thor draws a sword and STABS it into the ground to slow his
momentum. Draws the other sword and faces off against Hulk.

                    THOR (CONT'D)
          Banner, we're friends. This is
          crazy. I don't want to hurt you!

They engage again.   Hulk KICKS Thor, sending him SLAMMING
into the wall.

                    GRANDMASTER
          Here we go.

Thor jumps down just in time to avoid Hulk's warhammer, which
HITS so hard that it remains lodged in the wall.

With Hulk charging again, Thor RIPS the warhammer out of the
wall and WALLOPS Hulk with it.

Hulk goes CRASHING alongside the arena. He ends up sprawled
out in a pile of rubble, slightly dazed.

                       GRANDMASTER (CONT'D)
          What?

ABOVE: Val is watching through a set of high-tech
binoculars. She reacts to Thor, reluctantly impressed.
                                         .


Thor advances on Hulk with all the swagger. He takes off his
helmet and CALLS OUT to Hulk, provoking him.

                    THOR
          Hey, big guy. The sun's getting
          real low.

Hulk takes off his helmet.   Scowling.   Teeth GRINDING.

                    THOR (CONT'D)
          That's it. The sun's going down.
          I won't hurt you anymore. No one
          will.

WHOOSH! Thor is suddenly dragged out of frame. Hulk has
Thor by the leg and is WHIPPING him against the arena floor.
Over and over and over again.

IN THE VIP BOX: Loki's whole mood shifts. The joy returns to
his face, like "everything will be alright!" Loki LAUGHS.

                    LOKI
          Yes! That's how it feels!
              (to Grandmaster:)
          I'm just a huge fan of the sport.

Thor is SMASHED into the floor face first.

Hulk ROARS and RUSHES Thor with his axe.

                    THOR
          All right. Screw it.

CLANG! The giant weapons CLASH! Now Thor and Hulk are
fighting warhammer versus battleaxe...

...and Thor is winning! He's getting the better of these
exchanges, using Hulk's aggression against him. Thor
continually KNOCKS and/or TRIPS Hulk off his feet while
evading all of Hulk's best attacks.

                    THOR (CONT'D)
          I know you're in there, Banner.
          I'll get you out!

One particular vicious blow DISARMS Hulk, and Thor BREAKS
Hulk's axe with the warhammer. Thor then BASHES Hulk in the
chest, KNOCKING him to the ground.

                    THOR (CONT'D)
          What's the matter with you? You're
          embarrassing me! I told them we
          were friends!
                                         .


GROWLING, Hulk stands up and HITS Thor with a straight jab
that sends Thor TUMBLING across the arena. Hulk immediately
LEAPS after him and LANDS ON Thor!

Hulk is now on top of Thor as they slide across the arena,
just PUMMELING him with punches. Left-right-left-right.
Thor's head snaps back and forth.

In the carnage, Thor sees VISIONS OF ODIN.   Then-

-his eyes GLOW WHITE WITH ELECTRICITY. Like an instinctual
defense mechanism, Thor suddenly KNOCKS HULK BACK WITH A
BURST OF LIGHTNING!

Seething with electricity, Thor springs to his feet and then
BLASTS HULK WITH A MASSIVE LIGHTNING PUNCH! Hulk is LAUNCHED
BACKWARDS and Thor hits the ground HARD.

                    CROWD
          Thunder! Thunder! Thunder!

                    KORG
          Thunder! Thunder! Thunder!

The crowd gets hushed.   They've never seen this before.

IN THE VIP BOX: Grandmaster is pissed.   Loki is amazed.

Hulk and Thor sger to their feet. Thor looks at himself,
a little surprised. There are still small charges of
lightning CRACKLING through his veins.

Meanwhile, Hulk RUMBLES towards Thor and they're at it again,
close-quarters boxing. Thor is winning the exchanges,
landing BRUTAL PUNCHES to Hulk's body. And then suddenly-

-BZZZ! The Grandmaster ZAPS him with the Obedience Disk fob!
Thor drops, totally caught off guard!

Hulk plants his feet and JUMPS! He ZOOMS UP, rocketing out
of the arena, up-up-up into the sky! At the apex of his jump
Hulk clenches his fist and begins a missile-like descent.

Val sees this from her ship and decides to take off, like
"This fight is over, time to beat traffic."

                    KORG (CONT'D)
          Another day, another Doug.

Down below, Thor groggily turns over. He does so just in
time to see Hulk coming at him like an atom bomb!

No time to avoid it. KA-BOOM!!! Right before impact Thor's
eyes go lightning white. Hulk HITS Thor like a meteor.
                                             .


     The impact knocks Thor unconscious and we CUT TO BLACK.
     Linger on darkness for a few beats...and then:


   INT. THRONE ROOM - SUNSET                                       

     Hela sits on the throne trying to get comfortable, headdress
     & cowl off. Skurge stands at the foot of the throne.

               What is that noise?

                         SKURGE
               The common folk aren't exactly
               falling in line. There's a
               resistance trying to knock down the
               front gates.

     Hela sends her BUTCHER TROOPS to deal with it.

                         HELA
               Tell me about yourself, Skurge.

                         SKURGE
               Well, me dad was a stonemason, me
               mum was-

                         HELA
                   (interrupts)
               I'll just stop you there. What I
               meant was what is your ambition?

                         SKURGE
               I just want a chance to prove
               myself.

                          HELA
               Recognition.
                   (then:)
               When I was young every great King
               had an executioner. Not just to
               execute people, but also to execute
               their vision. But mainly to
               execute people. Still a great
               honor.
                   (beat)
               I was Odin's executioner.

     Hela holds out her hand and uses her powers to FORM A DOUBLE-
     SIDED OBSIDIAN AXE, which she offers to Skurge.

                         HELA (CONT'D)
               And you will be my executioner.
               Let's begin our conquest.

       Reveal that the Bi-Frost sword is missing.

                           HELA (CONT'D)
                 That sword is the key to opening
                 the Bi-Frost.

       Hela thinks, seething.

       SPLASH! Boots running across the shallow water. We meet a
       family of refugees from the city. FATHER, MOTHER, SON (),
       and young daughter (). They're RUNNING FOR THEIR LIVES.

       Hot on their heels are a pair of Hela's sinister Butchers,
       hunting like a pack of wolves.

       After scrambling through a grove of trees the family make
       their way through a narrow pass. The Butchers are hot on
       their heels, their growls getting louder behind them when -
       BAM! The son runs right into a tall, immovable object...
                                                .


      HEIMDALL! No regal armor, no golden helm. This Heimdall has a
      thick beard and is wrapped in a cloak. The rest of the family
      arrive, desperation.

                             HEIMDALL
                Excuse me.

      In one swift motion Heimdall draws the BI-FROST SWORD, steps
      forward and SLASHES through the Butchers, ending them.

      He then turns to the family, gestures for them to follow him.

                          HEIMDALL (CONT'D)
                Sorry about that. These bloody

      into the rock is YGGDRASIL, the world tree. Heimdall kneels,
      whispers a few words under his breath, and... A HUGE SECTION
      OF THE MOUNTAIN FACE VANISHES IN A SHIMMERING ILLUSION!

      city after Hela's invasion are living here. Men, women, and
      children. Strong and weak, young and old.

      Heimdall turns to the family, even manages a smile.

                          HEIMDALL
                You'll be safe here.

      Thor's eyes POP OPEN. He's lying in a heap on the ground,
      still dirty, bruised, and beat up.

      Thor is being tended to by TWO SAKAARIAN GLADIATOR NURSES who
      are swabbing his wounds. This freaks him out, which results
      in startled thrashing. That freaks out the two Gladiator
      nurses, which results in them RUNNING AWAY.
                                          .


Thor starts to get up, but then winces.      He moves slowly.

He's in a GIANT ROOM with stark graphic patterns on the
walls. With a few achy grimaces, Thor stands up and wanders
around. There's furniture, large cushions, and a sleeping
area enclosed by the SKULL of a giant beast.

NOISE behind him.    Thor follows the noise to find-

Hulk having eased himself into a large steaming JACUZZI. Thor
looks at him quizzically. Hulk isn't angry. He's RELAXED,
but he's not turning into Banner.

                    THOR
          Are we cool?

Hulk grunts.   I guess so.

                    THOR (CONT'D)
          It's Hulk in a hot tub.
              (then:)
          How long have you been like that?

                       HULK
          Like what?

                       THOR
          Like this.     Big, green, ...stupid.

                    HULK
          Hulk always Hulk.

Thor takes this in, and then walks over to a window that
looks out across the city. Does some spatial math, realizes:
Thor looks back out the window.

He sees a ramshackle SPACESHIP taking off and ROCKETING
skyward. Higher and higher, it's going for a wormhole when-

-BOOM! One of Grandmaster's Palace Patrol ships, more modern
and heavy duty, BLOWS it out of the sky.

On Thor, wheels turning.      He turns to Hulk.

                    THOR
          How'd you get here?

                       HULK
          Winning.

                    THOR (CONT'D)
          Were they wearing one of these when
          you won? How'd you arrive here?

                       HULK
          Quinjet.

Hulk mimes a plane landing in the water.

                     THOR
          Yes.   Where is the Quinjet now?

Hulk stands up, and exits the hot tub, naked.

                    THOR (CONT'D)
          That's naked. He's very naked.
          It's in my brain now.

Hulk points out the window.

                       HULK
          Quinjet.

Thor sees the Quinjet in a massive alien junkyard.

                    THOR
          Yes! I'm getting us out of here.
          This is a terrible, awful place.
          You're gonna love Asgard. It's
          big. It's golden. Shiny.

Hulk sits on his bed, eating a pumpkin.

          Hulk stay.

                    THOR
          No, no, no. My people need me to
          get back to Asgard. We must
          prevent Ragnarok.

          You're of the Avengers. One of the
          team, one of our friends. This is
          what friends do. They support each
          other.

          You're Banner's friend.

          you.

          Banner's friend.

          I don't even like Banner.

          Fine. Stay here. Stupid place.
          It's hideous, by the way. The red,
          the white. Just pick a color.

Thor heads for the exit, a wide open door.

                       HULK
          Smash you.

      ZAP! Thor's jolted back by the obedience disk.       There are
      perimeter sensors in the doorway.

      Hulk CHUCKLES at Thor as he hits the floor.      Points.

                             HULK
                  Thor go again!
                      (then:)
                  Thor home.

      TIME CUT:

      Thor slumps against the wall, head sagging.

      Hulk grabs his giant battleaxe.       He's armored up.

                            HULK (CONT'D)
                  Hulk trains.

                            THOR
                  That's great. Have fun.

      Hulk exits. Thor watches him go. Then, at the end of the
      hallway Hulk meets up with Valkyrie! They begin play-
      fighting, a clearly friendly rapport.

      Thor can't believe it. He runs to the entrance, but by the
      time he reaches the perimeter sensors they are gone.

      Thor sighs. Walks over to the window. Looks up through a
      wormhole, stars twinkling on the other end of it.

                            THOR (CONT'D)

                  see.

      Pause. Then Thor's eyes go golden like Heimdall's!         The
      stars in the wormhole begin to WARP OVER THOR AND-

AA   INT. STREETS OF ASGARD - SAME                                    AA

       Thor suddenly finds himself in Asgard. Disoriented at first,
       Thor turns to see Heimdall hiding in the shadows.

       Heimdall harshly SHUSHES Thor and gestures for him to get up
       against the wall. Thor complies. Sees the refugees.

       After a beat a roving patrol of Hela's Butchers creep by
       through the street. They don't spot our heroes. Pause.

       Heimdall turns to Thor, speaks only in hushed whispers.

                           HEIMDALL
                 I see you. But you are far away.

                           THOR
                 What's going on here?

                           HEIMDALL
                 Come see for yourself.

       Without warning, Heimdall leads the family out of the alley
       and DASHES down the street. Thor follows...

       ...but then stops. Looks around to see THE OCCUPIED CITY OF
       ASGARD, emitting a smoky aura of chaos. A chilling sight.

       Down the street, Heimdall gestures for the family to slow
       down. He sees something. Ushers them into an alcove.

       Thor joins them just in time to avoid being seen by another
       roving patrol of Hela's Butchers. Heimdall again motions for
       Thor to "shh" until the threat has passed. Then:

                           HEIMDALL (CONT'D)
                 I'm providing refuge in a
                 stronghold build by our ancestors.
                 But if the garrison falls our only
                 escape will is Bi-Frost.

                           THOR
                 You're talking about evacuating
                 Asgard?

                           HEIMDALL
                 We won't last long if we stay.

       Thor LOOKS OUT on a ravaged Asgard, heartsick.

       Hold on the devastated Realm as:
                                            .


                     HEIMDALL (O.S.) (CONT'D)
           She draws her power from Asgard and
           grows stronger everyday.

Back to Thor and Heimdall.

                        HEIMDALL (CONT'D)
           Come on.

As Heimdall quickly leads refugees down a safe pathway:

                     HEIMDALL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           Hela is ravenous. If I let her
           leave, she'll consume the Nine
           Realms and all the cosmos.

Turns back to Thor, approaches him.

                     HEIMDALL (CONT'D)
           We need you.

                     THOR
           I'm working on it, but I don't even
           really know where the hell I am.

Two packs of Butchers arrive simultaneously.        Spot Heimdall.

                     HEIMDALL
           You're on a planet surrounded by
           doorways. Go through one.

                        THOR
           Which one?

Heimdall RIPS into the attacking Butchers, CUTTING them down.

                     HEIMDALL
           The big one!

WHOOSH!   SUDDENLY THOR'S GONE!     BLACK.

After slashing through the Butchers, Heimdall moves towards
the house where he hid the family... and then abruptly stops.

Heimdall turns slightly.       He sees something.

BINOCULARS POV: Heimdall looking right at us, the Bi-Frost
sword visible in his hand.

Reveal Skurge on a palace tower balcony, surveilling the city
with Asgardian E-noculars. Skurge lowers the E-noculars.

There is conflict on his face. He knows that he should report
this to Hela immediately...yet he doesn't spring into action.
                                            .


   INT. HULK'S WARRIOR SUITE - NIGHT                              

     Thor absentmindedly fidgets with his Obedience Disk.

     THUD! THUD! THUD! ...resonates around the room.   Hulk steps
     up to Thor, looking inquisitively down at him.

                           HULK
               Thor sad.

                           THOR
               Shut up.

     Hulk HITS Thor, bullying him into opening up.

                         HULK
               THOR SAD!!!

     Thor hops up, YELLS in Hulk's face.    Paces around.

                         THOR
               I'm not sad, you idiot. I'm pissed
               off! Angry. I lost my father. I
               lost my hammer.

     THUD! THUD! He turns to see Hulk punching his pillow.

     Hulk stops. Stares.

                         HULK
               Whining and crying.   Cry like baby.

                         THOR
               You're not even listening.

     Thor KICKS a random helmet.

                         HULK
               Don't kick stuff.

                         THOR
               You're being a really bad friend.

                         HULK
               You bad friend!

                         THOR
               You know what we call you?

                           HULK
               No.

                         THOR
               We call you the stupid Avenger.
                                        .


                    HULK
          You're tiny Avenger!

Hulk throws a shield that nearly decapitates Thor.

                    THOR
          What, are you crazy?

                       HULK
          Yes.

                    THOR
          You know what? Earth does hate you.

Hulk gets sad.   Wanders over to his bed to mope.

Thor realizes he went to far.    Joins Hulk on the bed.

                       HULK
          No.

                    THOR
          I'm sorry I said those things.
          You're not the stupid Avenger.
          Nobody calls you the stupid
          Avenger.

                       HULK
          It's okay.

                     THOR
          You just can't go around throwing
          shields at people. Could have
          killed me.

                    HULK
          I know. I'm sorry.     I just get so
          angry all the time.    Hulk always,
          always angry.

                    THOR
          I know. We're the same, you and I.
          We're just a couple of hot-headed
          fools.

                    HULK
          Yeah, same. Hulk like fire, Thor
          like water.

                    THOR
          We're kind of both like fire.
                                        .


                      HULK
            But Hulk like real fire. Hulk like
            raging fire. Thor like smoldering
            fire.

                      THOR
            Hulk, I need you to do something
            for me.

TIME CUT:   Morning.

BA-BOOM! BA-BOOM! BA-BOOM!

We follow Two Palace Guards as they enter Hulk's Suite.

Hulk is throwing a LARGE BALL against the far wall. It's so
hard it makes dents in the wall. Hulk stops and turns.

Reveal that the guards are escorting Valkyrie. They leave...
Valkyrie and Hulk face off.

                      HULK
            Angry girl!

Val bounds forward and gives The Incredible Hulk a big hug.
Hulk laughs and then begins playfully roughhousing with Val.

                      VALKYRIE
            What's going on? What do you...?

Hulk steps away, allowing Valkyrie to see Thor. Her smile
disappears. She stares at Hulk, so annoyed. Hulk mopes a
little. Like, "I done bad." Turns back to Thor:

                      VALKYRIE (CONT'D)
            You're so thick-headed that you
            can't tell when someone's hiding
            all the way across the universe and
            wants to be left alone?

                      THOR
            We need to talk.

                      VALKYRIE
            No, you want to talk to me.

Valkyrie turns to leave.

                      THOR
                (to Hulk:)
            I need her to stay.

Valkyrie is at the exit when the UPPER JAWBONE of Hulk's
massive skull bed CRASHES into frame, BLOCKING the doorway.
                                         .


Val shoots an annoyed sneer at Hulk.   Hulk SNORTS back.

                      HULK
          Stay!    Please?

Valkyrie looks him up and down. Obedience Disks to the max.

Hulk begins BOUNCING his ball against the wall again.

Valkyrie walks over to Hulk's bar, picks up an UNOPENED
BOTTLE of liquor. Hulk snorts, disapprovingly. Val puts it
down and finds something cheaper, she pops the cork.

                    VALKYRIE
          All right. Here's the deal. I'll
          listen to you till this is empty.

She TIPS BACK the bottle and starts CHUGGING.

                    THOR
          Asgard is in danger and people are
          dying. We need to get back there. I
          need your help...wow.

                    VALKYRIE
          Finished. Bye.

She has indeed finished. She goes to leave.

                    THOR
          Odin is dead.

Valkyrie stops short (the BALL BANGING noise continues). Her
silence speaks volumes. Thor has a realization.

                    THOR (CONT'D)
          Hela, the Goddess of Death has
          invaded Asgard.

                    VALKYRIE
          If Hela's back then Asgard is
          already lost.

                    THOR
          I'm going to stop her.

                      VALKYRIE
          Alone?

                    THOR
          Nope. I'm putting together a team.
          It's me, you, and the big guy.
                                         .


                     HULK
          No team.   Only Hulk.

                    THOR
          It's me and you.

                    VALKYRIE
          I think it's only you.

                    THOR
          Wait. Just listen. The Valkyrie
          are legend, elite warriors of
          Asgard. You are sworn to defend
          the throne.

                     VALKYRIE
          I'm not getting dragged into
          another one of Odin's family
          squabbles.

                    THOR
          What's that supposed to mean?

                    VALKYRIE
          Your sister. Her power comes from
          Asgard, same as yours.

Hulk's ball rolls into frame. An off screen GRUNT.   Val
picks it up and tosses it back to Hulk.

                    VALKYRIE (CONT'D)
          When it grew beyond Odin's control,
          she massacred everyone in the
          palace and tried to seize the
          throne. When she tried to escape
          her banishment, he sent the
          Valkyrie in to fight her back. I
          only survived because...
              (trails off, brooding)
          Look, I already faced her once back
          when I believed in the throne, and
          it cost me everything. THAT'S
          what's wrong with Asgard. The
          throne, the secrets, the whole
          golden sham.

Pause. Thor moves towards Valkyrie, goes to put a comforting
hand on her shoulder.

                     THOR
          I agree.

Val SNATCHES his hand.   They are close, face to face.
                                      0.


                    VALKYRIE
          Don't get familiar.

                    THOR
          I agree. That's why I turned down
          the throne. But this isn't about
          the crown. This is about the
          people. They're dying and they're
          you're people, too.

Val SHOVES him away.    Thor stumbles back.

                       VALKYRIE
          Forget it.     I have.

                    THOR
              (nods, understanding)
          Okay.

                       VALKYRIE
          Okay.

                    THOR
          Good. Great.

                       VALKYRIE
          Great.

                       THOR
          Thank you.

                       VALKYRIE
          For what?

                       THOR
          For this.

Reveal that Thor has lifted the fob device off Val's belt!

                    THOR (CONT'D)
          Didn't see that did you?

Thor presses the button and ALL THE OBEDIENCE DISKS EMBEDDED
IN HIS NECK AND BELT POWER DOWN! Confident smirk.

                     THOR (CONT'D)
          There... that's better. You know,
          go ahead. Stay here and get drunk
          and enslave people for that
          lunatic. Keep drinking. Keep
          hiding.
              (beat)
          But me...
                                                .


     Thor gestures for Hulk to toss him the ball.   Hulk does.

                         THOR (CONT'D)
               I choose to run toward my problems
               and not away from them. Because
               that's what...

     Thor HURLS IT at the MAIN WINDOW - It bounces off, hitting
     Thor in the face. He stands, facing Valkyrie.

                         THOR (CONT'D)
               Because that's what heroes do.

     Thor then SMASHES THROUGH THE WINDOW!   Hulk STANDS...

                         HULK
               Friend Stay!


0   EXT. GRANDMASTER'S PALACE - DAY                                    0

     Thor is sliding down the SIDE of the GRANDMASTER'S TOWER.

     He LAUNCHES HIMSELF OFF THE BUILDING and hurtles downward,
     LANDING casually on the street below. Finally free.


   EXT. THE STREETS OF SAKAAR - CONTINUOUS                            

     Thor is HAULING ASS.

     Never slowing down, Thor keeps the top of the arena in sight.

     A few blocks back: Hulk is in pursuit. He's BUMPING people,
     SWATTING vehicles out of the way, just being a menace.

     On Sakaar, the citizens APPLAUD for him! Even when Hulk
     DEMOLISHES a man's food cart, the man CHEERS Hulk on!


   EXT. MASSIVE ALIEN JUNKYARD - CONTINUOUS                           

     Thor SPRINTS in.   Looks around.   Man, this place is big.

     He RUNS down aisles of crushed and stripped spacecrafts, a
     giant smelter, and then into what looks like a used car lot.

     And then he sees it.   The Quinjet!


   INT. QUINJET - CONTINUOUS                                          

     Thor enters and rushes to the controls.
                                       .


                       THOR
          All right.     Come on.

He is pressing buttons and flipping switches.   After a beat-

-the flight deck POWERS UP! Thor places his hand on a pad
which SCANS his handprint. Lights up green.

          Point Break.

                    QUINJET (V.O.)
          Welcome, Point Break.

CAH-RUNCH! Hulk BARGES IN through the Quinjet door!

The Hulk approaches, scowling. Any metal that stands in his
way PEELS BACK. Frantic, Thor turns to the Quinjet's console.
                                      .


                    HULK
          Friend stay!

                    THOR
          No, no, no!

As Hulk enters, he DESTROYS the hull of the Quinjet.

                       HULK
          Stay!

                    THOR
          Stop! Stop breaking everything!

                       HULK
          Don't go!

Thor triggers a message on the flight console.

                    NATASHA (V.O.)
          Nice work, big guy. We don't know
          where Ultron's headed, but you're
          going very high, very fast.

Hulk stops short.    His whole demeanor changes.

Thor steps out of the way so that Hulk can see a recorded
message from NATASHA ROMANOFF on the console.

                    NATASHA (V.O.)
          ...So, I need you to turn this bird
          around, okay? We can't track you in
          stealth mode...

Hulk is now right up against the console screen.

                    NATASHA (V.O.)
          ...So I need you to help me out.
          Okay? I need you to...

                       HULK
          No!     No, Banner!

Hulk CONVULSES. Drops to his hands and knees. His whole
body warping. Hulk ROARS and GRABS at his face, SHAKING his
head, trying to fight this back. But he can't help it...

...HE'S TRANSFORMING BACK INTO BRUCE BANNER! The transition
is rough and chaotic, it's as if Banner is fighting to get
out of the Hulk. Throughout the process, Hulk SMASHES back
and forth, further WRECKING the Quinjet.

And then, calm.
                                       .


Thor rushes to Banner's side to help ease the transition.

                    THOR
          Banner. Hey, hey, hey. You all
          right, Banner? Sun's going down.
          Sun's going down. That's it,
          breathe. I won't hurt you. Sun's
          going down.

                     BANNER
          ...Thor?

                     THOR
          Yeah.

Banner is groggy, disoriented. Thoughts, memories, and
observations begin to flood his brain randomly.

                    BANNER
          What happened to your hair?

                    THOR
          Some creepy old man cut it off.

                    BANNER
          It looks good.

                     THOR
          Thanks.

                    BANNER
          Where are we? How's Nat?

                    THOR
          Nat is good, I'm sure.

                    BANNER
          And what about Sokovia?

                     THOR
          Sokovia?

                    BANNER
          The city, Sokovia.   Did we save it?

                    THOR
          Banner, listen.

                     BANNER
          What?

                     THOR
          Sokovia. Ultron.     That was two
          years ago.
                                        .


                    BANNER
          What are you saying? I've been Hulk
          for two years?

                    THOR
          I'm afraid so.

Banner's eyes BULGE.    Trying to process this information.

                    BANNER
          What the hell happened?

Banner rushes to his feet.      Thor follows.

                    THOR
          Banner, there's something you
          should know...

Banner goes to the flight console.

                    QUINJET (V.O.)
          Voice Activation required.

                       BANNER
          Banner.

                    QUINJET (V.O.)
          Welccome, Strongest Avenger.

                    THOR
              (puzzled)
          What?

                    BANNER
          Ship's log...

THE SHIP'S LOG POPS UP ON SCREEN.

FROM BEHIND THE DISPLAY (within the monitor looking out) we
see fragmented images of the Hulk's trip through deep space.

We see the angry green giant thrash around in zero gravity.

We see Hulk closer to the camera now, looking stressed and
car sick.

THROW FOCUS to see Banner's face watching the video, Hulk's
freaked out face is super-imposed over Banner's freaked out
face.

                    BANNER (CONT'D)
          Thor, where are we?
                                       .


                    THOR
          Yeah, about that.

Banner hears:

                    GRANDMASTER (O.S.)
          It's bad news, bad news today.

Banner rushes over to the windshield.   Through it he sees-

-Grandmaster, his hologram projection towering over the city.

                    GRANDMASTER (CONT'D)
          Sakaar, hear ye. Attention please.
          I have some bad news. My beloved,
          exalted Champion has turned up
          missing. Take to the streets.
          Celebrate my champion.

                    BANNER
          Who's that?

                    THOR
          He kind of runs the place. You
          actually lived in his house.

Back to Banner.    A distant, confused stare.

                       BANNER
          I did?

                    THOR
          Yeah. Quite a lot's happened. You
          and I had a fight recently.

                       BANNER
          Did I win?

                    THOR
          No, I won. Easily.

                    BANNER
          Doesn't sound right.

                    THOR
          Well, it's true.

                    GRANDMASTER
          It seems that that criminally
          seductive Lord of Thunder has
          stolen him away.
                                               .


                         THOR
               Seductive GOD of Thunder.    We need
               to move.

                         BANNER
               Oh, no. This is bad. This is
               really, really bad. Thor, I think
               I'm freaking out.

                         THOR
               No, no, no. Don't freak out.
               You're okay. Put these on.

     Thor tosses Banner some clothes.    Banner looks at them.

                         BANNER
               These are Tony's clothes.

                         THOR
               I know, come on.

                         BANNER
               Is he here?

                         THOR
               No, he's not here. But listen.
               Just stay calm, okay? The sun's
               going down. The sun's getting
               really low. Sun's going down.


   INT. GRANDMASTER'S CHAMBERS - DAY                                 

     Loki and Valkyrie are brought before Grandmaster, who has at
     least tripled the amount of bodyguards around him.

                         GRANDMASTER
               I'm upset! I'm very upset. You
               know what I like about being upset?
               Blame. Right now, that's the
               mindset that I'm in. And you know
               who I'm blaming?

                         LOKI
               Grandmaster, I-

                         GRANDMASTER
               Hey! Don't interrupt me!

     Topaz hands the melt stick to the grandmaster.

                         TOPAZ
               Here you go.
                                              .


                         GRANDMASTER
               Why are you handing me the melt
               stick? He was interrupting. That's
               not a capital violation.
                   (refocuses)
               My precious champion has come up
               missing and its all because of that
               Lord of Thunder. It's all because
               of him.
                   (to Loki)
               YOUR brother. Whatever the story
               is. Adopted, or complicated. I'm
               sure there's a big history.
                   (to Valkyrie)
               And YOUR contender.

                         LOKI
               My dear friend, if you were to give
               me twelve hours I could bring them
               both back to you.

                         VALKYRIE
               I can do it in two.

                         LOKI
               I could do it in one.

                          GRANDMASTER
               You know what? I woke up this
               morning thinking about a public
               execution. But for now, I'll
               settle for this sweet little "who's
               gonna get him first?" So you're on
               the clock.


   INT. GRANDMASTER'S PALACE - DAY                                  

     Valkyrie exits in a hurry.   Loki follows her.

                         LOKI
               What have you done!?

     Val reverses position, putting Loki up against the wall.

                         VALKYRIE
               I don't answer to you, lackey.

                         LOKI
               It's Loki. And you will answer to
               the Grandmaster.
                                              .


     Loki moves to reverse position again, but Val BREAKS AWAY,
     drawing her TWO BLADES. In response, Loki UNSHEATHES two
     long Sakaarian daggers. They eye each other, and then-

     -FIGHT! A fast-paced and deadly battle of knives. After a
     few exchanges, Val connects a BIG SHOT that SLAMS Loki into
     the wall. He scowls.

                         LOKI (CONT'D)
               Why would you help my brother
               escape with that green fool?

                         VALKYRIE
               I don't help anyone.

     Loki trails off.   He sees her wrist markings.   A realization.

                         LOKI
               You're a Valkyrie. I thought the
               Valkyrie all died gruesome deaths?

     Now Val ATTACKS Loki! She gets him up against the wall, her
     blade against his throat. She looks ready to kill him.

                         VALKYRIE
               Choose your next words wisely.

                         LOKI
               Terribly sorry. Must be a very
               painful memory...

     Quick as a rattlesnake, Loki GRABS Val's head and CASTS an
     illusion. Val's eyes CLOUD OVER with darkness as we go to:


   EXT. HELA'S DIMENSION - FLASHBACK                                 

     A barren black void of death.

     The VALKYRIE, in old school Asgardian armor, charge through
     the DIMENSIONAL RIFT, an open portal to Asgard and the Nine
     Realms. Val witnesses these events as moments frozen in time.

     - Reveal Hela in all her glory, black lightning everywhere.

     - Dozens of Valkyrie falling through the dark space.

     - The Valkyrie's winged horses lay dead on the battlefield.

     - Through the open portal we can see the throne of Asgard.

     - Hela advancing on the final few Valkyrie - one is Val,
     frozen in fear, shell-shocked.
                                           0.


     - Hela FIRING black weapons at Val...

     - One of Val's sisters DIVING IN at the last second, SHOVING
     VAL back through the PORTAL and taking the fatal hit!

     - Val lands hard in the Throne room.

     - Val scrambling to her feet and trying to re-enter the rift
     but it's too late. It closes, the last image she sees is Hela
     dealing the final killer blow to her doomed Valkyrie sisters.


   EXT. GRANDMASTER'S PALACE - CONTINUOUS                          

     We find Val on her knees in front of Loki, trembling from
     this visceral memory that she's tried so hard to suppress.

     She turns on Loki, raging, and knocks him out.


   EXT. SAKAAR - STOOP - DAY                                       

     BANNER sits, groaning, head in his hands. THOR is beside
     him, rubbing his back and on the lookout for threats.

                         THOR
               The sun's going down. It's getting
               really low. The sun's going down.
               It's getting real low.

                         BANNER
               Would you stop saying that!?

                         THOR
               I just need you to stay calm.

                          BANNER
               Calm!?   I'm on an alien planet!

                         THOR
               It's just a planet.   You've been on
               a planet before.

                           BANNER
               Yeah!    One!

                         THOR
               Now you've been on two. That's a
               good thing. It's a new experience.

                         BANNER
               My neurons, they're firing faster
               than my brain can handle the
               information.

           BANNER (CONT'D)
The whole thing is totally
different this time.
    (beat)
In the past, I always felt like
Hulk and I each had a hand on the
wheel, but this time it's like he
had the keys and I was locked in
the trunk.

          THOR
Alright, well, you're back now,
that's all that matters.

          BANNER
No, it's not what matters. What
I'm trying to tell you, is that if
I turn into the Hulk again, Banner
may never come back. And we're
stranded on a planet that is
designed to stress me out.

          THOR
We're not stranded, I'm gonna
figure out a way to get us home.

             BANNER
Thank you.

          THOR
Not your home, though.   Asgard.

             BANNER
What?

          THOR
Listen, my people are in great
danger. You and I, we have to
fight this really powerful being
who also happens to be my sister.

          BANNER
Okay, that is so wrong on so
many... I don't wanna fight your
sister. That's a family issue.

          THOR
No, she's an evil being.

          BANNER
I don't care what she is.   I'm not
fighting any more beings.   I'm sick
of it. I just told you.
          (MORE)
                                      .

                    BANNER (CONT'D)
          If I turn into the Hulk, I am never
          gonna come back again. And you
          don't care.

                    THOR
          No, no. I'm putting together the
          team. The Hulk is the fire.

                    BANNER
          Wait, you're just using me to get
          to the Hulk.

                        THOR
          What?   No!

                    BANNER
          It's gross. You don't care about
          me. You're not my friend.

                    THOR
          No! I don't even like the Hulk.
          He's all like... "smash, smash,
          smash." I prefer you.

                        BANNER
          Thanks.

                    THOR
          But if I'm being honest, when it
          comes to fighting evil beings, he
          is very powerful and useful.

                    BANNER
          Yeah, Banner's powerful and useful,
          too.

                    THOR
          Is he though?

                    BANNER
          How many PhDs does Hulk have?
          Zero. How many PhDs does Banner
          have? Seven.

                    THOR
          Fine, you don't have to fight
          anyone. But we're in danger here,
          so we have to move.

Thor grabs a towel from the ground next to him. He puts the
towel over his head.

                    BANNER
          What are you doing with that?
                                         .


                    THOR
          I need a disguise.    I'm a fugitive.

                    BANNER
          I need a disguise.

                    THOR
          You are the disguise.

Banner finds a pair of Stark's sunglasses in his jacket.

                    BANNER
          I'll be Tony Stark.

                     THOR
          What?

                     BANNER
          Yeah.   Tony and the gypsy.

                    THOR
          No, no you're not Tony.    You're
          Bruce Banner.

                    BANNER
          Then why did you dress me up like
          Tony?

                    THOR
          Because you were naked.

                    BANNER
          Okay, I'll give you that.

They stand up. Banner adjusts his crotch.

                    THOR
          What are you doing?    Stop doing
          that!

                    BANNER
          Tony wears his pants super tight!

                    THOR
          Why are you being so weird?

                    BANNER
          I don't know. Maybe the fact that I
          was trapped for two years inside of
          a monster made me a little weird.

Banner flashes green.    Thor calms him down.
                                               .


                           THOR
                 Hey. It's okay. You're good.
                 Calm down. Come on. Listen, we're
                 gonna go to Asgard and you're not
                 gonna have to think about the Hulk
                 ever again. All right?

                              BANNER
                 All right.

      WHAP!   Banner gets nailed in the face with green paint.

      Caught off guard, Thor and Banner are swept off into-


A   EXT. PARADE OF VICTORS - CONTINUOUS                              A

      It's a massive street festival where revelers dance and cheer
      while throwing powdered paint at each other... in celebration
      of Hulk! Green EVERYWHERE!

      Inside the parade it is total chaos. Thor searches for Banner
      as he's PELTED with green powder. Pandemonium. In the crowd
      Thor sees a pack of SCRAPPERS on the hunt for the reward.

      Thor spots Banner. He surges forward, GRABS Banner, and
      pulls him into another alley, but sees-

      -Valkyrie is approaching from down the alley!

                           THOR
                 This is bad. Banner!     Banner!

      Thor pulls Banner back into the crowd. Thor briefly turns to
      see that he is no longer holding Banner's - it's the arm of a
      SMALL ALIEN who squeals in fright.

      Thor sees Banner across the crowd.

      Thor MUSCLES his way through the madness, knocking rowdy fans
      aside. He reaches Banner and holds him protectively,
      awkwardly trying to rub his shoulders.

      One of the aliens Thor knocked aside turns out to be a
      MASSIVE SCRAPPER. He rears up, turning on Thor and Banner.

      WHAM! From out of nowhere, Valkyrie CLOCKS this Scrapper
      with a brass knuckle right cross. The Scrapper DROPS.

      Thor looks at Val while clutching Banner like a child.

                              THOR (CONT'D)
                 Hi.
                                           .


                          VALKYRIE
                Hi.

                          THOR
                I was gonna do that.

                          VALKYRIE
                Yeah, well, I did it first.

                          THOR
                That's good. What are you doing
                here?

                          VALKYRIE
                What are you doing here?   I thought
                you were leaving.

                          THOR
                I got sidetracked.

                          VALKYRIE
                What's with the...

                          THOR
                It's my disguise.

                          VALKYRIE
                But I can see your face.

                          THOR
                    (covers his face)
                Not when I do this, you can't.
                    (then:)
                Your hair looks nice. I like what
                you did with it. Change it? Washed
                it maybe?

      Valkyrie just rolls her eyes, takes Thor by the arm.

                          BANNER
                    (to Thor:)
                What are those things on her eyes?
                Are those the people that she's
                killed? She's so beautiful and
                strong...


B   EXT. SAKAARIAN STREET - MOMENTS LATER                        B

      Valkyrie escorts Thor and Banner through the street.

                          VALKYRIE
                Who is this guy?
                                           .


                          THOR
                He's a friend.

                              BANNER
                Who?    Me?    I'm Bruce.

      As Val leads them into Sakaarian apartment building.

                          VALKYRIE
                I feel like I know you.

                          BANNER
                I feel like I know you too.

A   INT. SAKAARIAN BUILDING - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS               A

      Continue down the hallway.

                          VALKYRIE
                Look, I've spent years in a haze
                trying to forget my past. Sakaaar
                seemed like the best place to drink
                and forget and to die one day.

                          THOR
                I was thinking that you drink too
                much, and that probably was going
                to kill you.

                          VALKYRIE
                I don't plan to stop drinking, but
                I don't want to forget. I can't
                turn away anymore. So, if I'm
                donna to die, well... it may as
                well be driving my sword through
                the heart of that murderous hag.

                              THOR
                Good.

      They arrive at a door.     Before they enter:

                          VALKYRIE
                Yeah. So I'm saying that I wanna
                be on the team. Has it got a name?

                          THOR
                Yeah, it's called the Revengers.
                                             .


                            VALKYRIE
               Revengers?

                         THOR
               Because I'm getting revenge.
               You're getting revenge.
                   (to Banner:)
               Do you want revenge?

                         BANNER
               I'm undecided.

                            THOR
               Okay.

                         VALKYRIE
               Also, I've got a peace offering.


   INT. VALKYRIE'S APARTMENT - DAY                                 

     Valkyrie opens the front door, revealing-

     -Loki! He is as restrained as anyone could be, sitting in
     the middle of the apartment with a dozen chains around him.

                            LOKIE
               Surprise.

     Thor TOSSES a bottle.    It BOUNCES off of Loki's head.

                            LOKI
               OW!

                         THOR
               Just had to be sure.

                         LOKI
               Hello, Bruce.

                         BANNER
               So, last time I saw you, you were
               trying to kill everybody. Where
               are you at these days?

                         LOKI
               It varies from moment to moment.

     Val's apartment is a shithole. Bottles everywhere, blood-
     spattered clothes in the corner, a knife in the wall, etc.

     Banner gives Thor a look like "she might be crazy."   Thor
     responds with a "No, she's cool" gesture.
                                      .


Val lays something on the bed. Unwraps it to reveal AN OLD
ASGARDIAN SWORD. Thor's eyes go wide as she sharpens it.

                    THOR
          Is that... a Dragonfang?

                    VALKYRIE
          It is.

                    THOR
          My God. This is the famed sword of
          the Valkyrie.

                    VALKYRIE
          Sakaar and Asgard are about as far
          apart as any two known systems.
          Our best bet is a wormhole just
          outside the city limits.

A nice clean wormhole outside the city.

                    VALKYRIE (CONT'D)
          Refuel on Xandar and be back in
          Asgard in around  months.

                    THOR
          Nope. We're going through that one.

Thor points at the nightmare tornado wormhole over the ocean.

                    VALKYRIE
          The Devil's Anus?

                    BANNER
          Wait, whose anus are we going
          through?

                    THOR
          For the record, I didn't know it
          was called that when I picked it.

                    BANNER
          That looks like a collapsing
          neutron star inside of an Einstein-
          Rosen Bridge.

                    VALKYRIE
          We need another ship.   That would
          tear mine to pieces.

                    THOR
          She's right. We need one that can
          withstand the geodetic strain from
          the singularity.
                                         .


Banner gives Thor a quizzical look.

                    BANNER
          And has an offline power steering
          system that could also function
          without the on-board computer.

                    VALKYRIE
          And we need one with cup holders,
          because we're gonna die. So,
          drinks!

                    BANNER
          Do I know you? I feel like I know
          you.

                    VALKYRIE
          I feel like I know you, too. It's
          weird.

                    THOR
              (to Banner:)
          What do you say, doctor? Uncharted
          mealactic travel through a
          volatile cosmic gateway. Talk about
          an adventure.

Thor and Banner high five as Val stares at them blankly.

            BANNER                      THOR (CONT'D)
We need a ship.                 Need a ship.

                    VALKYRIE
          There are one or two ships,
          absolute top-of-the-line models--

                    LOKI
          I don't mean to impose, but the
          Grandmaster has a great many ships.
          I may eve have stolen the access
          codes to his security system.

All eyes turn to Loki. Valkyrie throws her bottle at him. It
smashes above his head.

                    VALKYRIE
          And suddenly you're overcome with
          an urge to do the right thing.

                    LOKI
          Heavens, no. I've run out of favor
          with the Grandmaster.
                    (MORE)
                              0.

                    LOKI (CONT'D)
          And in exchange for codes and
          access to a ship I'm asking for
          safe passage...through the anus.

                    THOR
          You're telling us you can get us
          access into the garage without
          setting off any alarms?

                    LOKI
          Yes, brother. I can.

                    BANNER
          Okay, can I just... A quick FYI, I
          was just talking to him just a
          couple minutes ago and he was
          totally ready to kill any of us.

                    VALKYRIE
          He did try to kill me.

                    THOR
          Yes, me too. On many, many
          occasions. There was one time when
          we were children, he transformed
          himself into a snake, and he knows
          that I love snakes. So, I went to
          pick up the snake to admire it and
          he transformed back into himself
          and he was like, "Yeah, it's me!"
          And he stabbed me. We were eight
          at the time.

Loki suppresses a smile.

                    VALKYRIE
          If we're boosting a ship, we're
          gonna need to draw some guards away
          from the palace.

                    LOKI
          Why not set the beast loose?

                     THOR
          Shut up.

                    VALKYRIE
          You guys have a beast?

                    THOR
          No, there's no beast. He's just
          being stupid. We're going to start
          a revolution.

               I'll explain later.

   INT. THE ARENA - GLADIATOR CELLS - MOMENTS LATER                

     Korg sits with his cell mates.    He's talking to Miek.

                         KORG
               Is that some sort of protoplasm,
               all the stuff that's coming out of
               you? Or are they eggs? Looks like
               eggs.

     Suddenly his Obedience Disk POWERS DOWN. No longer glowing.

     As Korg stands up, Valkyrie appears at the door to his cell.

                         VALKYRIE
               I'm looking for Korg.

                         KORG
               Who's asking? I know you're
               asking. Is anyone else asking, or
               is it just you?

     Valkyrie tosses him a high-tech rifle.

                have been deactivated and the
                slaves have armed themselves.

                          GRANDMASTER
                Oh! I don't like that word!

                No. Why would I not like
                "mainframe?" No, the "S" word.

                          TOPAZ
                Sorry, the "prisoners with jobs"
                have armed themselves.

                          GRANDMASTER
                Okay, that's better.

      CHA-CHNK! SOUNDS OF MACHINERY as the whole space starts
      moving. A different angle reveals that we are in-


A   EXT. THE STATESMAN - CONTINUOUS                                 A

      Grandmaster's chambers are actually the oversized cockpit of
      a A HUGE RIOT CONTROL SHIP (The Statesman) that can dock
      itself indefinitely within the palace!

      The Statesman has DISLODGED from the palace and is now
      flanked by six smaller Sakaarian peace-keeping ships, all
      headed towards the city where RIOTING can be heard.


    INT. GRANDMASTER'S PALACE - GROUND LEVEL - CONTINUOUS           

      Thor waits as Loki enters codes to a door's security panel.

                          THOR
                Hey, so listen, we should talk.

                          LOKI
                I disagree. Open communication was
                never our family's forte.

                          THOR
                You have no idea. I've had quite
                the revelation since we spoke last.

      The door opens, revealing a bunch of guards.
                                            .


     Thor and Loki heft up two Sakaarian guns.

                         THOR (CONT'D)
               Hello!

                         LOKI
               Hi!

     Thor and Loki BLAST all the guards, moving to another door.

                         LOKI (CONT'D)
               Odin brought us together, it's
               almost poetic that his death should
               split us apart. We might as well
               be strangers now. "Two sons of the
               crown" set adrift.

     A guard tries to ambush Loki through the door.   Thor TAKES
     OUT the guard.

                         THOR
               Thought you didn't want to talk
               about it?


   INT. GRANDMASTER'S PALACE - ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS              

     Thor and Loki are going up.

                         LOKI
               Here's the thing. I'm probably
               better off staying here on Sakaar.

                         THOR
               That's exactly what I was thinking.

                         LOKI
               ...Did you just agree with me?

                         THOR
               This place is perfect for you. It's
               savage, chaotic, lawless. Brother,
               you're going to do GREAT here.

                         LOKI
               Do you truly think so little of me?

     Thor pauses, considers his brother.   Then:

                         THOR
               Loki, I thought the world of you.
               I thought we were gonna fight side
               by side forever. But, at the end of
               the day, you're you, I'm me...
                         (MORE)
                                        .

                     THOR (CONT'D)
           I don't know, maybe there's still
           good in you, but let's be honest,
           our paths diverged a long time ago.

Loki is wounded by Thor's willingness to discard him.    Masks
his feelings with:

                     LOKI
           It's probably for the best that we
           never see one another again.

Beat.   Thor pats Loki affectionately on the shoulder.

Hold on Loki. Did Thor just get through to him?

                     THOR
           That's what you always wanted.

Beat.   Then:

                     THOR (CONT'D)
           Hey, let's do "Get Help."

                        LOKI
           What?

                     THOR
           "Get Help."

                        LOKI
           No.

                     THOR
           Come on, you love it.

                        LOKI
           I hate it.

                     THOR
           It's great. IT works every time.

                     LOKI
           It's humiliating.

                     THOR
           Do you have a better plan?

                        LOKI
           No.

                     THOR
           We're doing it.
                                              .

   INT. GRANDMASTER'S PRIVATE GARAGE - CONTINUOUS                   

     Multi-tiered platforms with dozens of cool spaceships.

     The elevator doors open. Thor supports Loki's weight with
     Loki faking a fatal injury.

                         THOR
               Get help! Please! My brother, he's
               dying.

     A small group of Sakaarian guards turn toward Thor and Loki.
     One guard aims his gun at them.

                         THOR (CONT'D)
               Get help! Help him!

     Thor picked up Loki and flings him at the guards, knocking
     them down like bowling pins. Loki stands up and Thor steps
     to Loki's side.

                          THOR (CONT'D)
               Classic.

                         LOKI
               I still hate it. It's humiliating.

                         THOR
               Not for me, it's not.

                         THOR (CONT'D)
               Which one's the ship she told us to
               get?

                         LOKI
                   (points)
               The Commodore.

     The COMMODORE starship. Brand new, solidly built, sleek.

     As they walk towards it a DUPLICATE LOKI FORMS and LAGS
     BEHIND. The Loki walking with Thor is an illusion.

                         LOKI (CONT'D)
               Though I feel it won't make much of
               a difference...
                                            .


      We follow the real Loki as he slinks away towards the
      security system panel. He activates the panel and brings up a
      screen that will set off all the alarms palace-wide!

                            THOR (O.S.)
                Oh, Loki.

      Loki turns to see Thor looking not at all surprised.

                          LOKI
                I know I've betrayed you many times
                before, but this time it's truly
                nothing personal. The reward for
                your capture will set me up nicely.

      He triggers the alarm.


B   INT. GRANDMASTER'S PRIVATE GARAGE - CONTINUOUS                  B

                          THOR
                Never one for sentiment, were you?

                          LOKI
                Easier to let it burn.

      But then Loki sees Thor holding up a fob device. Loki
      realizes that Thor affixed an Obedience Disk on him in that
      heart-to-heart moment.

                            THOR
                I agree.

      BZZZT! Thor ZAPS Loki and HOLDS DOWN the button. Loki HITS
      the ground, WRITHING in pain. Thor approaches. Pause.

                          THOR (CONT'D)
                Oh brother, you're becoming
                predictable. I trust you, you
                betray me. Round and round in
                circles we go.

      Thor continues to "think about it" for a beat while Loki
      convulses in agony on the floor. Finally, Thor kneels down:

                          THOR (CONT'D)
                See, Loki, life is about, it's
                about growth. It's about change.
                But you seem to just wanna stay the
                same. I guess what I'm trying to
                say is that you'll always be the
                God of Mischief, but you could be
                more. I'll just put this over here
                for you.
                                             .


      Thor places the fob on top of the security panel, so close
      but so far from Loki's paralyzed reach.

                          THOR (CONT'D)
                Anyway, I got places to be so good
                luck.

      Thor is seen in the cockpit.

                          THOR
                All right, I can figure this out.
                It's just another spaceship.


    EXT. GRANDMASTER'S PALACE - MOMENTS LATER                      

      The massive garage doors OPEN. This sets off BLARING ALARMS
      to alert the palace of this unauthorized departure.

      The Commodore ship LIFTS OFF from the garage. In the cockpit
      Thor pushes forward on the throttle. The ship ZOOMS ahead.

                          GRANDMASTER
                Loyal Sakaarians, Lord of Thunder
                has stolen my ship and my favorite
                champion. Sakaarians, take to the
                skies. Bring him down. Do not let
                him leave this planet.

      BELOW: Pilots hastily RUSH to their Palace Patrol ships so
      as to pursue the Commodore.

      The first two ships out of the garage SWOOP AROUND behind
      Thor. The Patrol ships are LOCKING weapons on Thor when-

      -BOOM-BOOM!   They are both blown out of the sky by-

     spins upside down, yet her cockpit is still right-side up.

                I hope that you're tougher than you
                look.

                Why?

     Val MAXES OUT the throttle. The ship ACCELERATES.     When
     she's under Thor's ship, Val presses-

     increasing volume. "aaaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH!!!!!"

     THUNK!   Banner is SHOT UP into the ship. ROUGH LANDING.

     Banner casually lifts his arm up and gives a THUMBS UP.

     CLUNK! CLUNK! CLUNK! CLUNK! The ship is being fired upon by
     another pursuit vehicle. Banner joins Thor.

                           BANNER
                Shouldn't we be shooting back or
                something?

                          THOR
                Yes, we should.
                    (into the radio:)
                Where are the guns on this ship?

                There aren't any. It's a leisure
                vessel.

                          THOR / BANNER
                WHAT?!

                          VALKYRIE
                Grandmaster uses it for his good
                times, orgies and stuff.

      Thor and Banner look around. The CEILING has MIRRORS ON IT
      and the floor is covered in a Sakaarian PERSIAN RUG.

                          BANNER
                Did she just say the Grandmaster
                uses it for orgies?

                          THOR
                Yeah. Don't touch anything.

      CLUNK! CLUNK! CLUNK! More fire from behind.

      But now in Val's cockpit... Sparks. Smoke. Alarms.

      Grandmaster is still taunting his former captives below when-

                          THOR
                I should probably go and help.

      Thor abruptly exits, leaving Banner at the ship's controls.

                          THOR (CONT'D)
                Here, take the wheel.

                          BANNER
                No. I don't know how to fly one of
                these.

                           THOR
                You're a scientist.   Use one of
                your PhDs.

      These two superhuman Asgardians begin jumping between their
      pursuer's ships, taking out guns, engines, and pilots with
      their bare hands. It's spectacular and epic.

      Thor RIPS out an engine block and uses it to crush a pilot.

      Val DRAGS her blades down the entire underbelly of a ship
      before BACKFLIPPING to another.

      Back and forth they go, even passing each other mid-flight a
      few times. One by one the Sakaarian ships GO DOWN.

      Banner is frantically STEERING the ship, doing his best to
      dodge all the incoming fire. He peels away and is followed
      by Topaz, who is in her own chase-ship.

      Banner notices a button with a little explosion icon.

                          BANNER
                Okay, come on. There's gotta be a
                gun on this thing. That looks like
                a gun.

      Banner PRESSES the button.
                                           0.


      The ship's lighting changes, like a disco effect. Weird dance
      music BLASTS over the PA, followed by Grandmaster's voice.

                          GRANDMASTER (V.O.)
                It's MY BIRTHDAY! It's MY BIRTHDAY!
                It's MY BIRTHDAY.

      Banner is so confused. Then we hear FIREWORKS.


B   EXT. THE SAKAARIAN OCEAN - CONTINUOUS                           B

      MASSIVE PLUMES of powder paint SHOOT OUT of the ship followed
      by a huge colorful fireworks display. And then a
      rainforest's worth of confetti is dumped from the hull!

      Topaz is suddenly in the middle of a party smoke screen! She
      tries to fly her way through all the fireworks and streamers,
      but ultimately she hits a HARD CRASH LANDING in the ocean.

                          BANNER
                Yeah!

      Meanwhile, Thor and Val land together on the one remaining
      Sakaarian ship. Val leaks a smile to Thor.

      Thor YANKS OFF the cockpit cover, Val TOSSES the pilot, and
      together they PUSH FORWARD on the throttle.

      The ship SPEEDS FORWARD. Just then Banner pulls the Commodore
      back on the scene, hovering above them.

      They LEAP UP towards the Commodore's open doors as the ship
      CRASHES and EXPLODES behind them!

      Korg then notices LOKI, TWITCHING and CONVULSING on the
      ground. He's barely made any progress towards the fob.

      Loki locks eyes with Korg, a desperate and furious plea.

      Korg looks at Loki, then at the fob, then back to Loki.

      Loki gives Korg a maniacal, pleading look.

      Korg gets it.   He deactivates the obedience disk.

      Loki stands, dusts himself off.

      The Commodore ship is swallowed up by the towering nightmare
      that is the Devil's Anus wormhole.

      The ship's onboard computer SHORTS OUT. Darkness in the
      cabin. All around them the hull CREAKS. Under strain.

      The commodore heads toward the end of the wormhole.   Debris
      flies past the camera.

      Thor, Val, and Banner all look like they are in extreme pain,
      as there's great concern the ship could be torn apart.

                Asgardians, some misguided soul has
                stolen the Bifrost sword. Tell us
                where it is, or there will be
                consequences. Bad ones.

      We are now in the smoking ruins of Asgard. 00+ Asgardians
      have been forced to line in a large piazza, all exhausted,
      all scared. Patrolling the perimeter are Hela's Butchers.

                            SKURGE (CONT'D)
                Well?

      Hela points to an Asgardian woman off camera.

                            HELA
                You.

      Hela's butchers approach the crowd and find the Asgardian
      woman. Skurge closes his eyes and looks downward.

                            ASGARDIAN CITIZENS
                No! Stop!

      Hela's butchers pull the Asgardian woman to the steps. They
      shove her and she falls tot he floor. The woman is on her
      hands and knees as Skurge turns to her. She trembles as
      Skurge holds his battle axe with both hands.

                           HELA
                Well?   Executioner?

       want to be affected by this gesture, but can't help it.

       They share a look as the Commodore lifts off into the air.

                someone else to rule. But it can't
                be you. You're just...the worst.

      Hela puts on her headdress.

                          HELA
                Okay, get up. You're in my seat.

                          THOR
                    (standing up)
                You know, Father once told me that
                a wise king never seeks out war.

                          HELA

      Heimdall leads the refugees out onto the bridge.

      But then he stops.    Sensing something.

      At the far end of the bridge is FENRIS!      The massive war wolf
      is guarding the observatory!

                            HEIMDALL
                Go back!

      The refugees turn to retreat.    Fenris CHARGES!

      GUNFIRE FROM ABOVE!

      The Commodore swoops onto the scene, Valkyrie manning the
      blaster and FIRING on Fenris, who stops his charge.

      As the refugees retreat, they come to a stop because...

      ...SKURGE IS LEADING AN ARMY OF BUTCHERS BEHIND THEM!

      Heimdall and the refugees are now trapped on the bridge
      between Fenris and Skurge!

      face to face, Hela glaring at Thor.

                          HELA
                To be honest, I expected more.

      Hela DISARMS him, sending Gungnir CLATTERING across the room.
      Hela strikes out sending Thor FLYING hard into a wall.

      Val and Banner hold the remaining Butchers off with GUNFIRE.

      Heimdall is looking toward the palace, concern for Thor. But
      his attention soon goes back to protecting the mass of
      humanity behind him. He looks out to the Observatory

                          HEIMDALL
                We must cross now! To Bi-Frost!

                Here's the difference between us.
                I'm Odin's firstborn, the rightful
                heir, the savior of Asgard.
                    (beat)
                And you're nothing.

      Hela PROJECTS a large spiked lance, Thor barely rolls out of
      the way before it PUNCTURES the wall.

      Thor HEADBUTTS Hela. It does nothing.   Hela responds with her
      own HEADBUTT. It does a lot.
                                               .

                see it.

      Hela RAKES a black-clawed hand across Thor's face. In doing
      so, she RIPS OUT ONE OF HIS EYES!

      Valkyrie keeps raining down fire on Fenris, but it is doing
      no real damage. Just pissing the wolf off.

      Heimdall sees Fenris charging and steps out in front of the
      refugees with his sword, preparing for the worst.

      Banner looks down at the carnage below.      Makes a decision.

      He gets up and heads for the bay doors.

                          BANNER
                Everything's going to be okay. I
                got this. You want to know who I

      we follow Banner's trajectory downwards. His face is
      determined, arms churning, ready to Hulk out...

      ...except it doesn't happen.     Worry washes over his face.

      SPLAT! Banner FACEPLANTS on the bridge, seeming to break
      every bone in his body. He looks dead.

      Pause. Fenris SNIFFS him curiously. We notice one vein on
      Banner's neck PUMPING GREEN. Then-

      -Banner suddenly EXPLODES UP as THE INCREDIBLE HULK, UPPER-
      CUTTING Fenris in the jaw! Hulk is now in a wrestling match
      with a beast four times his size - the two of them go
      TUMBLING into the water below.

                You see? No one's going anywhere.
                    (then:)
                I'll get that sword even if I have
                to kill every single one of them to
                do it.

      Val pilots the Commodore towards the battle on the city side
      of the bridge. Skurge's battlion of Butchers surge forward-

      -BOOM! Val LANDS the Commodore on top of them, SKIDDING
      across the bridge, CRUSHING the front line of the Butchers,
      and KNOCKING Skurge aside. The impact triggers the party
      function, setting off PARTY MUSIC and a FIREWORKS DISPLAY.

      Val emerges from the ship in full battle mode. Behind her,
      the Commodore FIREWORKS provide a spectacular HERO BACKDROP.
      She draws DRAGONFANG and smiles as Butchers begin swarming
      towards her. She is where she needs to be.

      Meanwhile, the Asgardians huddle together, packed so tight
      that some begin to fall off the side of the bridge, loved
      ones grabbing them and pulling them back up. There's no hope.
                                      .


Heimdall FIGHTS off Butchers, but gets KNOCKED DOWN.   Just as
it looks like he's about to take a killing blow-

-BAM!   The Butcher is BLASTED.

Korg steps into frame, holding the blaster!

                      KORG
           Hey man.   I'm Korg.   This is Miek.

Miek steps into frame, waving.

                     KORG (CONT'D)
           We're going to jump on that
           spaceship and get out of here.
           Want to come?

Heimdall is beyond confused, but then... a LOUD NOISE. Hela
looks down to see-

-EMERGING FROM THE THICK LOW-HANGING FOG IS LOKI! Resplendent
in horns, arms spread wide, seeming to float towards the
bridge like a mythical angel of mercy.

                     LOKI
           Your savior is here!

The fog dissipates around him, revealing that Loki's standing
on THE GRANDMASTER'S SUPERCRUISER! For reasons that will
become clear, we will henceforth call this ship THE ARK.

And Loki is not alone. He's brought along all the prisoners
from the Contest of Champions. Armed with gladiator weapons.
The Ark slows to a stop at the middle of bridge.

ABOVE: Even with Hela's hand on his throat, Thor can't help
but smile at the sight of Loki. Hela however sneers.

                     HELA
           That little shit.

BELOW: Loki and the Sakaarian gladiators JUMP OFF the Ark and
onto the bridge, joining the fight against Hela's forces.

                      LOKI
           Did you miss me?    Everybody on that
           ship, now.

The Asgardian refugees begin POURING onto the ark. The only
way onto the Ark is a narrow plankway, so there is an
immediate bottleneck effect - thousands of frightened people
all pushing for a chance at salvation. It's mayhem.

Loki walks through the crowd to Heimdall.
                                              .


                          HEIMDALL

                          LOKI
                Of course you did.

      Loki joins Heimdall and the gladiators in fending off Hela's
      encroaching minions.

                          HELA
                A valiant effort, but you never
                stood a chance.

      Thor looks up from his friends protecting his people as they
      frenziedly board to Ark to-

      -the twilight stars coming out over Asgard.   There's a
      glimmering of stardust in the sky.

                 Even when you had two eyes you were
                 only seeing half the picture.

       Thor turns to see his father, sitting where we last saw him.
       Thor falls to his knees.

                           THOR
                 She's too strong.   Without my
                 hammer I cannot--

                 Are you Thor, God of Hammers?

       Thor looks up, meeting his gaze.

                           ODIN (CONT'D)
                 That hammer helped you control your
                 power, focus it. But it was never
                 the source of your strength.

       Odin stands, as does Thor.

                           THOR
                 It's too late. She's already taken
                 Asgard.

                           ODIN
                 Asgard is not a place. Never has
                 been.
                     (gestures around him)
                 This could be Asgard. It is
                 wherever our people stand. And
                 right now those people need you.

       Odin turns to go.

                 I'm not as strong as you.

                 No.   You're stronger.

       It's pandemonium. The Ark's engines are deafening, but you
       can still hear the sound of terrified people SCREAMING.

       Thor helps Loki to his feet.

                           THOR
                 You're late.

                           LOKI
                 You're missing an eye.

       Valkyrie finishes off a handful of enemies, but then notices
       something. She WHISTLES to get the others' attention.

                           VALKYRIE
                 This isn't over.

       All around the bridge, our heroes look to see-

       -Hela arriving at the far side of bridge.   She is seething
       with power, a vision of death.

       Having just come out of this huge battle, they are all weary
       and nursing injuries. Loki and Val are hurting worse than
       Thor.

       Hela walks towards them.   Menacing and deliberate.

       Thor, Loki, and Val step forward to protect the Asgardians.
       They huddle together.

                            THOR
                 I think we should disband the
                 Revengers.

                           LOKI
                 Hit her with a lightning blast.

                           THOR
                 I just hit her with the biggest
                 lightning blast in the history of
                 lightning. It did nothing.

                           VALKYRIE
                 We need to hold her off until
                 everybody's on board.
                                        .


Thor looks at the people boarding behind him.

                    THOR
          It won't end there. The longer
          Hela's on Asgard the more powerful
          she grows. She'll hunt us down.
          We need to stop her here and now.

                    VALKYRIE
          What's our move?

                    LOKI
          I'm not doing "Get help."

Thor sees Hela approaching. He sees the palace behind her. He
comes to a realization.

                     THOR
          Asgard's not a place, it's a
          people.
              (then)
          This was never about stopping
          Ragnarok...it was about causing
          Ragnarok.
              (to Loki:)
          Go to the vault. Surtur's crown.
          It's the only way.

                    LOKI
              (impressed)
          Bold move, brother. Even for me.

Loki runs off, leaving Thor and Val to deal with Hela.

                       THOR
          Shall we?

                       VALKYRIE
          After you.

Thor ATTACKS. They CLASH, kicking off this monumental
confrontation. Hela manifests pitch black weapons to attack
Thor, but Thor is conjuring powerful bolts of electricity
with the same speed and ferocity.

Just as Thor is surging with newfound lightning powers,
Hela's powers seem to be enhanced as well.

The battle is relentless and fast-paced. Thor is holding his
own against Hela. Maybe they can win this thing.

After several fearsome exchanges, Hela PUNCTURES his shoulder
and then DARTS past him with startling speed.
                                                  0.


        Undeterred, Thor RUSHES Hela again.    Valkyrie joins in,
        forcing Hela to fight them both.

        While the Asgardians still scramble to get on board above-

        -find the Commodore ship, swooping down below the bridge.


BC0   INT. COMMODORE SHIP - CONTINUOUS                                   BC0

        Thor continues FIGHTING Hela while Valkyrie BLOCKS Hela's
        attempts to spear the Asgardians from afar.

        Hela isn't landing any fatal blows, but she's carving Thor up
        and making steady progress towards the Ark.

        However, the Asgardian refugees finally make it aboard. An
        injured Heimdall, Korg, and Miek are the last to get on.

        Thor and Heimdall make eye contact.    Thor calls out:

                             THOR
                  GO!   GO NOW!

        As the Ark's engines begin to POWER UP-

        -Hela HARPOONS Thor.    He goes down, grimacing in pain.

        Hela begins to CONJURE AN ENORMOUS MANIFESTATION OF HER
        POWERS, A GIANT BLACK SPIKE FROM THE BEDROCK OF ASGARD THAT
        STABS THE ARK AND PREVENTS IT FROM LEAVING!

        Butchers begin to scramble up onto the Ark!

        The refugees REACT IN TERROR as the Butchers begin CLIMBING
        from the bridge to the Ark. In the frightened crowd we find-
                                             .


       -Skurge, still cloaked. He sees innocent Asgardians huddled
       together, trying to protect their families. He's having a
       crisis of conscience. An epiphany.

       As he walks towards the Eternal Flame, The Tesseract draws
       his attention. Tempting him.


F0   EXT. THE ARK - CONTINUOUS                                       F0

       The first wave of Butchers arrives on board, heading straight
       for a cowering family. Just as they're about to be killed--

       POW! POW! POW!    The Butchers fall dead.

       Everyone turns to see SKURGE, now uncloaked, wielding his two
       M-s from Texas.

                           SKURGE
                 For Asgard.

       Skurge runs forward, LEAPS off the Ark, and LANDS on the
       bridge right where all the Butchers are coming to life.
       BLASTING AWAY the Butchers before they can get aboard.

       Behind Skurge, the Ark begins to LIFT OFF.

       Skurge keeps FIRING and then-

                             SKURGE (CONT'D)
                 HELA!

       Hela turns to see Skurge blasting his way through her
       Butchers, trying to make his way to her.

       Disappointed, Hela FIRES a blade through Skurge's heart.

       Skurge has been killed...

       ...but the Ark now ASCENDS unfettered.

    EXT. RAINBOW BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS                               

       Hela has Val in her clutches, but her focus is on the
       aftermath of Skurge's last stand and the Ark's subsequent
       escape. She's furious, about to unleash hell when-

                            THOR (O.S.)
                 HELA!   Enough!

       Hela turns to see Thor, having yanked out the harpoon...

       ...and it looks like he's laying down his sword!

                           THOR (CONT'D)
                 You want Asgard? It's yours.

                           HELA
                 Whatever game you're playing, it
                 won't work. You can't defeat me.

                           THOR
                 No, but he can.

       KA-BOOM! EXPLODING through the roof of the palace is SURTUR!

       This is a different Surtur than the opening. He is slowly
       but steadily GROWING in size, and he carries with him a
       massive flaming sword, which GROWS as well.

       Surtur's arrival literally SHAKES the bedrock of Asgard,
       causing FISSURES to spiderweb all around him, and DISLODGING
       some of the foundation on the bridge and around the palace.

       Hela's eyes go wide. She wasn't expecting this.

                            HELA
                 No...NO!

       In the background the Ark continues its ascent, now high up
       above the city.

       Hela's attention is on Surtur as the palace COLLAPSES around
       him. So she is unprepared for-

       -SHLNK! Mustering up all her remaining strength, Val DRIVES
       Dragonfang through Hela's chest, effectively PINNING her to
       the bridge.

       Refocused on Val, Hela goes to deliver a death blow when-

       -Thor BOLTS forward!   He PULLS Val from Hela's clutches.

       Thor turns and FIRES LIGHTNING INTO DRAGONFANG, which
       DISLODGES the section of the bridge that Hela is pinned to!

       The ground beneath Hela BREAKS FREE and she goes FALLING down
       into the expanding fissure in Asgard's bedrock.

       Badly injured, Thor and Valkyrie look up to see-

       -Surtur INCREASING in size, now towering over the palace.

                           SURTUR
                 Tremble before me Asgard, for I am
                 your reckoning!

       Surtur swings his sword, destroying an entire city block.

       THOR and VALKYRIE look up.

                           VALKYRIE
                 The people are safe.     That's all
                 that matters.

                           THOR
                 We're fulfilling the prophecy.

                           VALKYRIE
                 I hate this prophecy.

                           THOR
                 So do I, but we have no choice.

       In the background, Hulk hops up onto the bridge.   Looks
       around, zeroing in on Surtur.

                           SURTUR
                 Surtur destroys Asgard, he destroys
                 Hela so that our people can live.
                                              .


      Hulk CHARGES behind them, still unseen by Thor and Val.

                          THOR
                We need to let him finish...
                    (finally sees Hulk)
                No!

      HULK LEAPS UP AND LANDS ONTO SURTUR'S FACE and begins
      POUNDING the fire giant with furious punches!

                           THOR (CONT'D)
                Hulk no!   Stop it you moron!!

      It's not doing much damage, but the shock of it plus Hulk's
      impact makes Surtur take a destructive step back.

      Hulk is trying to rip out one of Surtur's horns when Surtur
      reaches up and GRABS HIM with a giant fiery hand.

      Surtur HURLS Hulk away from him.   Sends him CRASHING DOWN.

      Hulk stumbles to his feet, dazed and SMOKING. After gathering
      his bearings, Hulk gets REALLY ANGRY and heads back towards
      Surtur for round two, but-

                          THOR (CONT'D)
                Hulk, just for once in your life,
                don't smash!

                          HULK

                          VALKYRIE
                Hulk! Let's go.

      Hulk stops. Looking between Surtur and Thor & Val. This is
      a real Sophie's Choice for Hulk. On the one hand, he really
      wants to kill that thing. On the other hand...

                           HULK
                Friends.

      Hulk PICKS UP Thor and Valkyrie.   He then squats down, and-

      -LEAPS WITH ALL HIS MIGHT! The trio SHOOTS UP into the night
      sky like a rocket blasting off. Their trajectory is heading
      right at the Ark as it reaches the lower orbit of Asgard.

      From beneath the water, Hela EXPLODES back onto the scene,
      riding a huge spiked manifestation of her powers.

      She's going for Surtur.   ATTACKING with all her might.

      Surtur winds up, holding his sword above his head.

                          SURTUR
                I am Asgard's doom!!

                as the foundations are strong, we
                can rebuild this place. It will
                become a haven for all people and
                aliens of the universe...

      When the fiery sword touches the crystalline base of Asgard
      there is a VIOLENT DETONATION OF ENERGY!

      of the man looking back at him.

A   EXT. THE ARK - SPACE                                             A

       The giant cruiseliner is gliding through space, the twinkling
       of stars all around it.


    INT. THE ARK - MAIN DECK                                         

       Thor steps out onto the main deck to see an assembly of both
       Asgardian and Sakaarian refugees awaiting their King.

       Thor looks over his people and begins to walk through the
       crowd. His subjects part, allowing him through.

       It is the antithesis of the opening coronation from the first
       THOR movie. The people aren't cheering and lauding him, but
       rather they are smiling. Humbly bowing. Grateful.

       And Thor isn't acting arrogant. Not trying to show off any
       swagger. He is stately. A contemplative and dignified king.

       At the end of the procession, Hulk, Loki, Valkyrie, and
       Heimdall stand next to the CAPTAIN'S CHAIR.

                           VALKYRIE
                 Your throne.

       Pause. Reluctant acceptance. Thor sits down.

       Flanking him on opposite sides are Valkyrie and Heimdall.
       Behind/towering above them is the Hulk. Loki joins them.

                           HEIMDALL
                 So, King of Asgard.

       Thor turns around to see THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE staring back,
       silently awaiting word from their new King. Now feeling the
       true weight of the crown, Thor takes a moment... and then:

                              HEIMDALL (CONT'D)
                 Where to?

                           THOR
                 I'm not sure. Any suggestions?
                 Miek, what's your home planet?

       Angle on Korg, who is holding Miek (sans robot exoskeleton).

                           KORG
                 Oh, Miek's dead. I accidentally
                 stepped on him on the bridge, I've
                 just felt so guilty I've been
                 carrying him around all day...
                                              .


       Miek WRIGGLES to life.   Korg lights up.

                            KORG (CONT'D)
                  Miek, you're alive! He's alive
                  everyone! What was your question?

       Thor looks forward, taking charge of this one.

                            THOR
                  Earth it is.

       CUT TO BLACK.

       THE END.


    INT. THE ARK - DAY                                              

       THOR and LOKI look out the window.

                            LOKI
                  Do you really think it's a good
                  idea to go back to Earth?

                             THOR
                  Sure!   They love me there.

                            LOKI
                  Let me rephrase: Do you really
                  think it's a good idea to bring me
                  back to Earth?

       Thor smiles, getting it.    Pats Loki on the shoulder.

                            THOR
                  Probably not. But don't worry,
                  brother...I've got a feeling that
                  everything's going to work out.

       Then through the window, they see-

       -THE MASSIVE FORM OF SANCTUARY-, THANOS' WARSHIP
       approaching.


   EXT. THE ARK - SAME

       the Ark in size.

       END.

 EXT./INT.   TAXI CAB - MORNING                                        

    DEADPOOL, in full DRESS REDS and MASK, quietly FIDGETS in the
    BACK SEAT of a TAXI CAB as it proceeds along a CITY FREEWAY.

    Deadpool adjusts the two KATANAS strapped to his back. Rolls
    the WINDOWS up, down, up. Tries futilely to untwist the
    seatbelt, then LUNGES forward, locking it up. Rifles through
    a tourist booklet and tears out a HAUNTED SEGWAY TOUR coupon.
    The CABBIE, young, thin, brown, glances back and forth from
    the rear view to the road to the rear view.

                          DEADPOOL
                Kinda lonesome back here.

    CUT TO: DEADPOOL, WEDGING himself through the opening
    between the back seat and front. His two katanas don't
    cooperate, catching on the Plexiglas, stalling him mid-torso.

                          DEADPOOL (CONT'D)
                Little help?

    The cabbie grabs Deadpool's hand and pulls him through to the
    front. Deadpool's head rests upside down on the bench seat
    as he maneuvers his legs through. The cabbie turns the
    helping hand into a HANDSHAKE, then turns down the Juice.

                            CABBIE
                Dopinder.

                          DEADPOOL
                    (still upside-down)
                Pool. Deadpool.

    Dopinder is remarkably UNAFFECTED by the lunatic in his cab.

                          DOPINDER
                Why the fancy red suit, Mr. Pool?

                          DEADPOOL
                It's like Christmas Day, Dopinder. Been
                waiting one thousand eight hundred twenty-
                two days, three hours...
                    (checks `Adventure Time'
                     watch)
                ...and thirty-six minutes for this shit.




                                                                
                                                                      .
                  
                                                                

    DEADPOOL turns himself RIGHT-SIDE-UP in the front seat. He
    is YOKED to the gills and ARMED to the teeth. TWIN KATANAS.
    TWIN DESERT EAGLE . CALIBER PISTOLS.

    Deadpool grabs Dopinder's OPEN BAG of CORN NUTS. Dopinder
    isn't quick enough to stop him. Deadpool gazes out the
    window onto the city - a teeming, sooty urban sprawl that
    looks almost... pre-post-apocalyptic.

    Deadpool turns up his MASK. Dopinder catches a GLIMPSE of
    the bottom of a SCARRED face. And quickly looks AWAY.
    Deadpool eats the CORN NUTS. CRUNCH. CRUNCH. Points.

                             DEADPOOL (CONT'D)
                 Nice.

    Dopinder eyes his DAFFODIL DAYDREAM AIR FRESHENER and takes a
    deep breath through his nose.

                           DOPINDER
                 Smells good, no?

                           DEADPOOL
                 Not the Daffodil Daydream.      The girl.

    A PICTURE of a young INDIAN WOMAN is taped to the dash.

                           DOPINDER
                 Ah yes. Gita. She is quite lovely. She
                 was supposed to make me a very agreeable
                 wife. Mom and Dad chose her rather
                 excellently. But Gita's heart has been
                 stolen by my cousin Bandhu. Bandhu is as
                 dishonorable as he is attractive.

                           DEADPOOL
                 Dopinder, I'm starting to think I'm in
                 this cab for a reason.

                           DOPINDER
                 Because you hailed it?

                           DEADPOOL
                 No, my slender brown friend... to give
                 you one crucial piece of advice: Love...
                 is a beautiful thing. When it finds you,
                 the whole world smells like Daffodil
                 Daydream.

    Deadpool's own heartbreak is palpable.        He takes another
    deep, cleansing BREATH.


                          DEADPOOL (CONT'D)
                So hold onto love tight. Go at Bandhu
                hard. Get Gita back. Or else... the
                whole world will taste like Mama June
                after hot yoga.

                          DOPINDER
                And how does Ms. Mama June taste?

                          DEADPOOL
                Like two hobos making love under a
                drizzle of Limburger- I could go all day
                like this. Point is, bad.

    Deadpool chucks the bag of Corn Nuts into the back seat and
    pulls out his PISTOLS. He starts CHAMBERING shells into two
    magazines.

    Suddenly, he frantically pats himself down, like a Hollywood
    agent who can't find his phone.

                          DEADPOOL (CONT'D)
                Shiiiit. My extra mags! I usually leave
                them right by the door so I'll trip over
                them! Someone must've moved them...

   INT.   DEADPOOL'S LAIR - DAY                                          

    A blind late-'s AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMAN in a purple floral
    dress enters the front door, falls as she trips over an `I
    *HEART* HELLO KITTY' DUFFEL BAG of AMMUNITION, PICKS it UP,
    and CARRIES it OFF.

   INT./EXT.   TAXI CAB - MORNING                                        

                          DOPINDER
                Shall we turn back?

                          DEADPOOL
                No time. Not today.
                    (slides in last bullets)
                Ten, eleven, twelve... or bust.
                    (chambers a shell into each
                     gun, looks up)
                Right here!

    The cab SCREECHES to a stop on the shoulder of the highest
    FREEWAY in a massive INTERCHANGE of freeways. Dopinder halts
    the meter and hands Deadpool his CARD.

                            DOPINDER
                My card.    That's $..

                
                                                              

                           DEADPOOL
                 Oooo. I never carry a wallet when I'm
                 working. Ruins the lines of my suit.
                 How 'bout a crisp high five?

    Dopinder stares as he and Deadpool slap skin.        Deadpool GETS
    OUT of the cab.

                           DOPINDER
                 Be sure to... ask for me again?

                           DEADPOOL
                 I owe you one. Merry Christmas,
                 Dopinder.

                           DOPINDER
                 And a convivial... Tuesday in April to
                 you, Pool... Guy.

    Deadpool closes the door with a flourish.         Boom.

   EXT./INT.    `THE RAFT' PRISON - MORNING                             

    A bone-white ISLAND PRISON, affectionately nicknamed `The
    Raft,' looms ominously in a CITY HARBOR.

    Etched in helvetica into the prison wall: `No punishment has
    ever possessed enough power of deterrence to prevent the
    commission of crimes.' - Hannah Arendt. Below it, GRAFFITIED
    in RED SPRAY PAINT: `Until NOW'

    The prison's FRONT DOORS OPEN, and out steps a handcuffed
    PRISONER, 's, ORANGE JUMPSUIT, broad shoulders, whip-smart,
    tightly coiled, with cool, dead-blue eyes. BURLY GUARDS
    guide him across a CAUSEWAY toward a CONVOY of Escalades and
    Ducatis on shore.

    The middle Escalade's door opens.       The prisoner stops.   The
    guards unlock his CUFFS.

                           GUARD
                 You're someone else's problem now.

    The ex-prisoner STRETCHES his arms and strides TOWARD the
    convoy.

                             PRISONER
                 Yes.   I.   Am.

    CUE SALT & PEPA'S `SHOOP:'
                                                                   .
                



   EXT.   FREEWAY OVERPASS - DAY                                       

    DEADPOOL sits on the edge of the highest freeway on the
    overpass, legs dangling over the side like Huck Finn.

                         DEADPOOL
               Can I get some fries with that shake-
               shake boobie? If looks could kill you
               would be an uzi.

    Deadpool is using some broken CRAYONS to draw something on a
    scrap of paper. REVERSE ANGLE to REVEAL a childish drawing
    of Deadpool SHOOTING another man in the head, brains blowing
    out.

    The victim's thought bubble reads: `OUCHIE!!!'       Even through
    the mask, Deadpool looks pleased by this.

    He turns to CAMERA:

                          DEADPOOL (CONT'D)
               Oh, hello, Deadpool here. You may be
               wondering whose balls I had to fondle to
               get my own movie. Rhymes with
               `Polverine.' Couple'a smooth criminals.
                   (ALT:)
               In a word, gorgeous.
                   (ALT:)
               Surprisingly little hair down there.
                   (ALT:)
               It's a jungle down there.
                   (ALT:)
               Thick underbrush.
                   (beat)
               Anyway, I smell Oscar. The suit's gonna
               match the carpet. Now... places to be...
               faces to fix... bad guys to kill...

    ANGLE ON a distant BIRD'S EYE VIEW of the freeway
    interchange: an interwoven tangle of ramps.

   EXT. REMOTE AIRFIELD - MORNING                                      

    AJAX, 's, dead-blue eyes, broad shoulders, whip-smart,
    tightly coiled stands at ease on a cracked and blistered
    tarmac. Behind him, a HEAVILY ARMED CONVOY OF DUCATIS and
    ESCALADES. FOUR LARGE ALUMINUM CARGO CRATES sit beside him.

    Ajax squints into the sun as A BELL HELICOPTER thrashes the
    air above him, kicking up dust as it lands.




                                                              
                                                                     .
                  
                                                               

    A SERBIAN WARLORD, mid-'s, sharply dressed, armored
    BRIEFCASE in hand, climbs out. He is surrounded by ARMED
    GUARDS.

    The Warlord places the BRIEFCASE on the FOREMOST CRATE. Ajax
    pops the case... to find STACKS upon STACKS of THOUSAND
    DOLLAR BILLS. Satisfied, he closes the briefcase and hands
    it to one of his men.

                           AJAX
                     (bangs crate)
                 They won't disappoint.

                           WARLORD
                 They'd better not.    And next month's
                 shipment?

                           AJAX
                 There won't be one. Demand is high. You
                 aren't the only one with a war to win.

                           WARLORD
                     (steps forward)
                 That won't do.

    Both sets of armed thugs shift to ready positions.

    Ajax smiles calmly, but his free hand DARTS OUT and CASUALLY
    LIFTS the warlord into the air by the THROAT. Fingers find
    triggers on both sides.

                           AJAX
                 There's been a small... disruption in our
                 supply chain. We'll deliver in full the
                 following month. Say, ten percent off
                 for the inconvenience?

    The Warlord manages to nod in acquiescence.       Ajax smiles
    again, lowers him gasping to the ground.

                           AJAX (CONT'D)
                 We appreciate your business.

    Ajax spins and walks purposefully toward the line of waiting
    SUV's.

    The warlord angrily motions for his men to begin loading the
    crates into the helicopter, which they do.

                           WARLORD
                     (sotto voce)
                 Fucking mutant.
				 
    Behind him the convoy of SUV's and motorcycles pull out,
    falling into line as they accelerate past the rows of
    derelict aircraft.

   EXT.   FREEWAY OVERPASS - DAY                                         

    DEADPOOL watches as the convoy approaches. He CASUALLY gets
    up as if standing up out of an easy chair...

                         DEADPOOL
               On your mark, get set, go, let me go, let
               me shoop...

    He PIROUETTES, and DROPS an entire level DOWN...

   INT. ESCALADE - MORNING                                               

    THROUGH the SUNROOF of an ESCALADE.     SMASH!

    There are FOUR HUGE BAD-ASSES inside the S.U.V., two in
    front, two behind. Deadpool lands back-middle in a HAILSTORM
    of GLASS. He stuns the men to both sides with elbows to the
    face as he raises his arms in greeting.

                          DEADPOOL
               Â¡Hola! Â¡Me llamo Piscina De La Muerte!
                   (subtitled, in YELLOW:)
               Hello! My name is the Pool of Death.
               There's no easy way to say this. I'm
               pregnant, Trevor.
                   (ALT:)
               Any of you seen Green Lantern? Me
               neither.

    BOOM! MAYHEM ERUPTS as the two men in back find themselves
    sharing a phone booth with the TASMANIAN DEVIL: ELBOWS.
    FOREARMS. KNEES. CRACKING. CRUNCHING. SCREAMING.

    From BEHIND, the Escalade BUCKS and BOUNCES down the road on
    its suspension, almost CARTOON-LIKE.

    A brutal punch spins Deadpool UPSIDE-DOWN, and he rolls with
    it, uses his FEET to BREAK the man's NECK. The other man
    stomps on his head, then drags him up and SMUSHES Deadpool's
    face into the seat's premium trim.

                         DEADPOOL (CONT'D)
               Rich... Corinthian... Leather.

    Deadpool HURLS the man through THROUGH the TAILGATE WINDOW.

    The man clutches the TAILGATE, DRAGGED behind the S.U.V.
    Deadpool sticks his head between the two guys in FRONT.
                                                   

                           DEADPOOL (CONT'D)
                 Scuse, por favor!

    The DRIVER SLAMS Deadpool's head into the console repeatedly.

                             DEADPOOL (CONT'D)
                 Ow.   Ow.   Ow. Ow. Ow.

    Deadpool squirms away and WRESTLES VIOLENTLY with the guy in
    the PASSENGER SEAT.

    He GRABS the PASSENGER SEAT-BELT, TIES it around the guy's
    ANKLE, and KICKS him out the PASSENGER SIDE DOOR. The guy's
    HEAD and SHOULDERS SMACK pavement, where he's DRAGGED
    mercilessly by his ANKLE - a modern COWBOY whose boot just
    got stuck in his horse's STIRRUP.

    Deadpool grabs the driver by the HAIR on the BACK of his HEAD
    and BANGS his FOREHEAD into:

    The horn. HONK. HONK. The stereo. Every time the driver's
    forehead SMACKS the face of the stereo, the RADIO STATION
    CHANGES:

    MARIACHI. DR. DREW. MONSTER TRUCK COMMERCIAL ('SUNDAY,
    SUNDAY, SUNDAY!'). One more SMACK to get us back to
    MARIACHI.

    Deadpool looks in the REAR VIEW MIRROR to see the man in back
    CRAWL up the tailgate.

    Deadpool PUSHES in the Cadillac's CIGARETTE LIGHTER.

    Back to the DRIVER. Deadpool BASHES his face into the
    DRIVER's SIDE WINDOW. THUMP. THUMP. THUMP.

    We're now OUTSIDE the Escalade, seeing the driver's
    expression take on a ridiculous silly-putty-esque grimace of
    pain every time it's MUSHED into the glass.

    The man in back scrambles forward. The CIGARETTE LIGHTER
    POPS OUT. Deadpool YANKS the EMERGENCY BRAKE. The man in
    back LAUNCHES forward and SMACKS the DASHBOARD.

    Deadpool STABS the now ORANGE-HOT lighter into the man's
    forehead, burning the COIL PATTERN into his skin. The man
    SCREAMS.

                           DEADPOOL (CONT'D)
                 Loved your work in Daredevil.

    Deadpool stuffs the lighter INTO the man's mouth and CLAMPS
    his hand over it.

      The man hollers in muffled agony. A MOTORCYCLE has pulled
      AHEAD of the ESCALADE and now sits, STOPPED, in its path.

      The helmeted RIDER OPENS FIRE with a SUB-MACHINE GUN.

      Deadpool has one hand grasped on the back of the driver's
      neck, still mashing his face into the window glass, and the
      OTHER hand still clamped over the second man's mouth. He
      plants both FEET on the steering wheel and `drives,' spinning
      the wheel, sending the S.U.V. into...

      ...a ROLL.    The Escalade goes ENDO, SOMERSAULTING WILDLY.

      Suddenly, the ACTION BEGINS TO SLOW...

      The motorcycle RIDER tries to bail out. NO LUCK. The
      tumbling Escalade PLOWS RIGHT INTO him AND his bike.

      Parts scatter off the motorcycle, including its CHAIN. The
      RIDER continues to SQUEEZE off ROUNDS as he goes FLYING.

      Inside the Escalade, Deadpool goes SPIN-CYCLE. The DRIVER
      flies through the sunroof, tearing out its remaining glass.
      BLOOD spatters. The other man spits out the glowing
      CIGARETTE LIGHTER. The guy whose ankle is still tangled in
      the seat-belt FLAILS through the air like a rag-doll, AHAB
      tied to MOBY DICK.

      The action CONTINUES to SLOW... until it FREEZES.

      The camera swoops in to Deadpool's face, upside down.

      HE TURNS HIS HEAD TO CAMERA FOR THE FIRST TIME, BREAKING THE
      FOURTH WALL, THE ONLY THING IN THE SCENE THAT'S MOVING:

                              DEADPOOL (CONT'D)
                   Shit.   Did I leave the stove on?

      We RAMP back UP to FULL SPEED. The S.U.V. CARTWHEELS. The
      guy's ankle untangles from the seat-belt. He FLIES high
      toward a big HIGHWAY EXIT SIGN and... SPLAT... out of frame.

      The RIDER's NECK is SLICED by the flying MOTORCYCLE CHAIN.

      The DRIVER is half-way out the SUNROOF when the S.U.V. rolls
      over him. SQUISH.

      The man who ate the CIGARETTE LIGHTER now eats pavement.

   INT.   KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS                                         

      The X-Men's COLOSSUS. A GOOD-NATURED GIANT with CHROME METAL
      FOR SKIN. BIG AS A BARN. OTHER-WORLDLY STRONG. He is
      sitting in the kitchen, eating a bowl of GRAPE NUTS and
      finishing a SUDOKU, his attention suddenly drawn to a
      TELEVISION SCREEN:

                             REPORTER
                   The assailant appears to be wearing a...

                   COLOSSUS                      REPORTER (CONT'D)
      Red suit?                            Red suit.

      With an audible CRACK, the pencil in Colossus' thick fingers
      snaps. He rises, muttering Russian curses and stalks from
      the kitchen.

   INT.   HANGAR - MOMENTS LATER                                       

      Massive STEEL BLAST DOORS emblazoned with a huge "X" slide
      open to reveal COLOSSUS. He walks quickly and purposefully
      towards a big plane in the center of the huge space: the
      BLACKBIRD, the X-Men's modified XR- jet transport.

      Struggling to keep up with the giant's long strides is a
      supernaturally CUTE, supernaturally DEADPAN -YEAR-OLD GIRL,
      in an X-MEN outfit. NEGASONIC TEENAGE WARHEAD.

                             COLOSSUS
                   I've given Deadpool every chance to join
                   us. And what is my reward? More
                   immaturity and criminality! When will he
                   finally grow up and see benefits of
                   becoming X-Man?

                             NTW

                   Was that sarcasm?    Awesome.

                   You ate breakfast, yes? Breakfast is
                   most important meal of day.
                       (hands NTW a protein bar)
                   Here. Protein bar, good for bones.
                   Deadpool may try to break yours.

      NTW shoves the bar in a pocket of her coat without breaking
      stride.

     EXT. FREEWAY OVERPASS - MORNING                                        

      The S.U.V. slides to a halt ON ITS SIDE, PASSENGER WINDOWS
      UP. The rest of the CONVOY is forced to stop BEHIND.

      A BUNCH of MEN PILE OUT, each one carrying a BEASTLY GUN and
      POINTING it STRAIGHT at the disabled S.U.V.

      The last noise is made by one final dislodged HUBCAP, which
      rattles in little circles until it lies FLAT on the freeway.

      TWO SILENT BEATS. Then we hear the soft, ELECTRIC BUZZ of
      the Escalade's middle passenger window ROLLING DOWN. Up pops
      the HEAD of DEADPOOL, like the GOPHER in Caddyshack.

      BANG BANG BANG BANG.

                             DEADPOOL
                   Wait, wait...

      The head drops, the hands come up.        BANG.

                             DEADPOOL (CONT'D)
                   Wait! You're probably wondering. Why the
                   red suit? It's so bad guys can't see me
                   bleed. This guy has the idea. He wore
                   the brown pants.
                       (to camera)
                   All together now...

      The THUGS immediately OPEN FIRE.

      Deadpool is already leaping upward, flipping backwards,
      bullets tearing the air beneath him as he pulls out those TWO
      MASSIVE . CAL PISTOLS... and in slo-mo, RETURNS FIRE.

      Deadpool keeps count of every bullet he fires:

                               DEADPOOL (CONT'D)
                   Twelve..!


                                                                   
                                                                      .
                  
                                                                 

    A SHELL-CASING is EJECTED. We enter EXTREME SLO-MO and SWOOP
    IN on the shell as it TUMBLES through the air...

    ...revealing the number `' ETCHED in a semi-circle on
    its butt end. Deadpool FIRES the second pistol. We move
    instantly to the second shell: `'

                             DEADPOOL (CONT'D)
                 Eleven...

    FULL SPEED.    The first TWO THUGS get a MOUTHFUL of BULLET.

                             DEADPOOL (CONT'D)
                 Ten...

    ANOTHER SHOT. A THUG takes one in the HEART.          The other
    thugs POUR LEAD into the disabled S.U.V.

    Deadpool LEAPS UP and OUT of the window, rising ABOVE the
    incoming shots, then LANDING SAFELY BEHIND the Escalade.

    Deadpool TURNS to SPY a MOTORCYCLE RIDER BEARING DOWN ON HIM.
    This rider wears a distinctive SILVER HELMET.

    Deadpool raises BOTH pistols. This RIDER LEANS away, dodging
    each slug. First left, then right, then left.

                             DEADPOOL (CONT'D)
                 Nine.    Shit! Eight. Fuck! Seven.       Shit-
                 fuck!

    The bike WHIZZES PAST safely, firing bullets, DEADPOOL
    follows, leaping high, flipping over the S.U.V.

    He lands smoothly the other side, right BEHIND a thug who's
    looking in the other direction as he sneaks around the car.

    Deadpool SHRUGS and SHOOTS him in the BACK of the HEAD at
    POINT BLANK RANGE.

                             DEADPOOL (CONT'D)
                 Six.

    The shell tumbles to the ground, falls still.         `'

    Deadpool opens the Escalade.       His target is NOT THERE.

    BANG-BANG-BANG-BANG-BANG. Deadpool is nearly BROUGHT DOWN by
    a particularly big thug with a particularly big AK-.

    He dives behind another Escalade, takes a moment to search
    the interior through the windows... and then flinches as AK-
     bullets pass THROUGH the skin of the S.U.V. around him.


                                                                 
                                                                    .
               
                                                           

    One of the bullets lands in DEADPOOL'S BICEP. Deadpool
    yelps, in pain... then stuffs some of his torn red suit
    fabric into the hole to staunch the bleeding.

    Then he scrambles AROUND the S.U.V., trying to close the
    distance to this guy through a WITHERING BARRAGE of fire.

    Another of the AK's slugs SLICES a swath out of the mask on
    Deadpool's head, SINGING his hair.

                         DEADPOOL.
              Fuck.   You.

    Deadpool lands in FRONT of the thug. The thug pulls his
    trigger again, only to - CLICK - realize he's OUT of BULLETS.

                        DEADPOOL
              Someone's not counting.    Cinco.

    The bullet HITS the thug in the throat.       `'

                        DEADPOOL (CONT'D)
              Me gusta cinco.

    Deadpool STRIDES past the fallen thug, pawing at his singed
    hair - ow - and then out of sheer, pumped-up ANGER...

    ...turns and PUMPS TWO MORE SUPERFLUOUS BULLETS into him.

                         DEADPOOL (CONT'D)
              Four.   Three. Stupid. Worth it.

    The SILVER-HELMETED MOTORCYCLE RIDER makes another pass,
    FIRING. Deadpool ducks behind the S.U.V. again.

     yards away, a GROUP of thugs TAKE COVER behind the final
    S.U.V. One pulls out a HAND-GRENADE, RAISES HIS ARM to
    throw.

                        DEADPOOL (CONT'D)
                  (chuckles)
              Number two...

    Deadpool FIRES, SHOOTING the GRENADE in the thug's FIST.
    BOOM! The whole CLUSTER of THUGS drops.

    Deadpool emerges from behind the S.U.V., feeling victorious.

    He approaches the final S.U.V. and throws open the doors to
    search, expecting to find his target at last.

    Inside is a rumpled orange prison coverall, but NOT the
    PRISONER. Deadpool gets childishly angry.


                                                               
                                                                    .
               
                                                           

                        DEADPOOL (CONT'D)
              What the shit-biscuit! Where you at,
              Francis?

    Worse, CLICK-CLACK.    The distinctive COCKING of SHOTGUNS.

     final THUGS stand on the freeway, lined up perpendicular to
    Deadpool, SHOULDER-TO-SHOULDER, FIRING BENELLI COMBAT
    SHOTGUNS.    BAM! BAM! BAM!

    Deadpool ducks behind the S.U.V. and raises a PISTOL. We
    ZOOM IN through the CHAMBER to spy the last BULLET, POISED in
    front of the FIRING PIN:

    `'

    Deadpool thinks, then LEAPS from behind the `SCLADE, TWISTS
    forward and right.

    All  THUGS FIRE again.    BUCKSHOT rips into DEADPOOL's BACK.

    But he LANDS so that all  men are now parallel to him...

    ...in A SINGLE-FILE LINE.

                           DEADPOOL (CONT'D)
              One.

    BOOM! We're with the FINAL BULLET as it HURTLES from the gun
    and passes THROUGH the first man's head... then the SECOND
    man's head... and SMACKS the third man in the forehead.

    This third man, the BIGGEST THUG YET, HITS the DECK.

    Deadpool puts his mouth to his pistol barrel, INHALES... and
    then EXHALES smoke through the pores of his mask.

                        DEADPOOL (CONT'D)
              I'm touching myself tonight.

    But then, as if by magic, the third thug STIRS... and STANDS.

    The SLUG has LODGED partway in his FOREHEAD, having lost just
    enough momentum that it didn't make it all the way through.

    The thug sneers, plucks out the slug, wipes away some blood,
    and rolls up his SLEEVES.

                           DEADPOOL (CONT'D)
              Really?     Rolling up the sleeves?

    Deadpool reaches back.    We hear the THRILLING SOUND...



                                                               
                                                                       .

                                                              

     ...of STEEL BLADES being DRAWN. Out come Deadpool's
     TRADEMARK KATANAS. The thug's eyes widen as...

     ...SWOOSH... the blades swing through the air and SKEWER him,
     between two different ribs and out the BACK.

                          DEADPOOL (V.O.)
                I know what you're thinking...

     The action SLOWS again to a FREEZE.      Deadpool is in mid-
     slice, muscles bulging.

                          DEADPOOL (V.O.)
                I'll bet he works out. So what if I am
                pulling the double shift at the ab-
                factory? What if I do want my man menu
                to feature the shredded beef? Call it
                insecurity. But I haven't touched a carb
                since...

   INT.   FOYER, TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT - PAST                                  

     Title:    Years Ago

     A sleazy, mid-thirties MAN, GAVIN MERCHANT, decked out in
     DRAGON PRINT V-NECK and STUDDED JEANS, is MID-ARGUMENT with a
     late teen, pimply-faced PIZZA DELIVERY GUY, whose name-tag
     reads: JEREMY.

                          MERCHANT
                Will it help if I slow down?         I didn't.
                Order. The pizza.

                          JEREMY
                This  Red Ledge Drive?
                    (off nod)
                And you're... Mr. Merchant?

                          MERCHANT
                The Mr. Merchant who didn't.         Order.
                The. Fucking. Pie.

                          JEREMY
                Then who placed the call?

     A TOILET flushes in another room, and both men turn.

                            WADE (O.S.)
                I did.




                                                                  
                                                                       .
                   
                                                                 

     The VOICE comes from over Merchant's shoulder. WADE WILSON
     (the future DEADPOOL, MINUS the SCARS and SUIT), handsome,
     boyish, cheerily steps from through a doorway and into the
     living room wiping his hands on a towel.

     Merchant STARES, incredulous.

                            WADE (CONT'D)
                  Pineapple and olive?

     Jeremy NODS.

                            WADE (CONT'D)
                  Sweet and salty.

                            MERCHANT
                  The fuck are you? And what are you doing
                  in my crib?!

     Without even turning toward Merchant, Wade PULLS OUT A .
     CALIBER DESERT EAGLE PISTOL and nonchalantly AIMS it at him.
     Merchant and Jeremy both go pale.

                            WADE
                      (to Jeremy)
                  Burnt crust?

                            JEREMY
                  God I hope not.
                      (opens the box, winces)
                  Words cannot express-

                            WADE
                  Relax, son, that's hows I likes it!      Once
                  you go black, you never go back!
                      (takes pizza)

                            MERCHANT
                      (stammering)
                  This is about the poker game, right? I
                  told Howie... Listen, take whatever you
                  want!

     Merchant fumbles with his wallet and starts to hand Wade the
     bills inside. Wade takes the ENTIRE WALLET instead.

                              WADE
                  Thanks!

                            JEREMY
                      (to Wade)
                  Uh. Sir? Before you do anything to him.
                  Could I have a big tip?


                                                                  
                                                                      .
                
                                                            

                         WADE
                   (already munching)
               Jeremy, is it?

                           JEREMY
               Yeah.

                         WADE
               Wade Wilson.
                   (quick fist bump)
               Jeremy, that's a no go on the tiperoo.
               I'm not here for him.
                   (levels gun at Jeremy)
               I'm here for you.

     Jeremy's eyes widen. Wade holds up a YELLOW CARD, featuring
     an embedded SIM. Below the logo of a CYPRESS TREE is the
     name of Wade's intended target: `GARRETT, JEREMY.'

     Merchant breathes a sigh of relief.

                         MERCHANT
               Dodged a big time bullet on that o-

     Wade PISTOL-PUNCHES/POKES Merchant in the forehead.           Merchant
     howls.

                         WADE
                   (re: studded jeans)
               Not out of the woods yet. You need to
               seriously ease up on the bedazzling.
               They're jeans, not a chandelier.
                   (sniffs)
               And the Axe body spray.

                         JEREMY
                   (sheepish)
               That's unfortunately me.

                         WADE
               PS, I'm keeping your wallet.         Ya did
               kinda give it to me...

                         MERCHANT
               Can I at least have my Sam's Club card
               baaa-

     Wade points the pistol at Merchant again, sending him
     backpedaling into a chair.

                         WADE
               I will shoot your fucking cat.



                                                                 
                                                                     .
                
                                                           

                         MERCHANT
               I don't have a cat!

                         WADE
               Then whose kitty-litter did I just shit
               in?
                   (turns to Jeremy)
               Anyhoo, you by chance know a Meghan
               Orlovsky? Getting that right? Orlovsky?
               Orloskvy? Do you?

     Jeremy manages a timid little NOD.

                          WADE (CONT'D)
               Good.   `Cause she knows you.

     Wade holsters the pistol and WHIPS out a HUNTING KNIFE. He
     twirls it adeptly... but instead of holding it to Jeremy's
     neck... CUTS himself a SLICE of PIZZA.

                         WADE (CONT'D)
               What situation isn't improved by pizza?

     Wade shovels half the slice into his mouth, revealing an Army
     SPECIAL FORCES TATTOO on his forearm: A SKULL WEARING A
     GREEN BERET, BACKED BY A BLADE, AND THE WORDS `DE OPPRESSO
     LIBER' (official motto of the U.S. Army Special Forces).

                         WADE (CONT'D)
                   (through chews)
               Jeremy, I belong to a group of guys who
               take a dime to beat a fella down.
                   (cuts another pizza slice)
               Little Meghan's not made of money, but
               lucky her, I've got a soft spot.

     Wade brings the next pizza slice over to Merchant. Wade
     nearly hands it to him but lets go too soon. The slice falls
     flat - pineapple down - onto the floor at Merchant's feet.

                            JEREMY
               B-but I'm-

                         WADE
                   (returns to Jeremy)
               A stalker. Threats hurt, Jer. Though
               not nearly as bad as serrated steel.

     Wade pokes the end of his knife into Jeremy's chest, pinning
     him against the wall.

                         WADE (CONT'D)
               So keep away from Meghan.       We cool?


                                                                
                                                                       .

                                                             

                            JEREMY
                Y-yeah.

     A beat. In a huge ANTI-CLIMAX, Wade deftly twirls his knife
     AWAY from Jeremy's chest, SPINS it on his finger, and JAMS it
     back into its SLEEVE.

                          WADE
                Then we're done.

                            JEREMY
                W-we are?

                          WADE
                Soft spot, remember? But even look in
                her general direction again? You'll
                learn in the worst of ways.
                    (pats Jeremy's cheek)
                I've got some hard spots too.
                    (pauses)
                That came out wrong. Or did it?

   EXT.   SKATE PARK - NIGHT - PAST                                        

     SKATE PUNKS carve on ramps built into the sides of a highway
     underpass. A group of TEEN GIRLS are perched at the bottom
     of the nearby stairs, texting each other from inches away.
     An old-fashioned GHETTO BLASTER bangs `SHOOP.'

                          SALT & PEPA
                I love you in your big jeans.

                          GIRLS
                    (join chorus)
                You give me nice dreams.     You make me
                wanna scream...

     Boom. A PIZZA BOX lands at their feet.          On top of it lands a
     POLAROID PICTURE.

                          WADE (O.S.)
                "Oooo, oooo, oooo!"

     A FRIZZY-HAIRED EMO GIRL picks up the Polaroid... of a
     terrified JEREMY holding another pizza box that has been cut
     into a heart, the words `I'm Sorry' scrawled onto it, a PEE-
     STAIN on his JEANS, and a laughing WADE photo-bombing with
     the knife to his neck. She looks UP to see:

     Wade bobbing to the music.

                          WADE (CONT'D)
                You've seen the last of Jeremy.


                                                                  
                                                                        .
                    
                                                                  

      The girl - MEGHAN ORLOVSKY - leaps up and HUGS Wade tight.

                             WADE (CONT'D)
                   That's why we do it.

                             GIRL #
                   Hey, think you could fuck up my step-dad?

                             GIRL #
                   How `bout Vice Principal Renwiki?

                             WADE
                       (suddenly serious)
                   What'd he do to you?

                             GIRL #
                   Suspended me for smoking.

                             WADE
                       (turns to go)
                   Good for him! Sorry, ladies. Me no dig
                   cigs. And I may look mean. But if I
                   give a guy a pavement facial? He earned
                   it.

      Wade gives Meghan a smile, turns to leave.

                              MEGHAN
                   Hey.   Thanks. You're my hero.

      The word catches Wade like a punch to the gut.         Hero?

                             WADE
                   That I ain't.

      Wade doesn't turn back, walking through the swooping skaters.

A   EXT.   SISTER MARGARET'S - NIGHT - PAST                                 A

      A grimy SIGN on a grimier brick building reads:         `SISTER
      MARGARET'S SCHOOL FOR WAYWARD GIRLS.'

    INT.   SISTER MARGARET'S - NIGHT - PAST                                 

      Inside, society's DREGS. Chief among them, BOOTHE: a HUGE,
      menacing hipster with a BOY SCOUT CAP and MASSIVE HANDLEBAR
      MOUSTACHE. He's got some DUDE's fingers splayed out on the
      bar, jabbing a KNIFE POINT between them as fast as he can.

      WADE shimmies past, backslaps BOOTHE:

                               WADE
                   Boothe!

                            BOOTHE
                      (turns, smiles)
                  Heya, Wade!

     We hear a STAB and a SCREAM.

     Wade winces as he continues on to the BAR, claims a STOOL and
     waves over the lone bartender - WEASEL, early 's, geeky,
     glasses. Think Tom Cruise in `Cocktail.' Then think the
     opposite.

                            WEASEL
                  Wade Wilson, Patron Saint of the Pitiful.
                  What can I get you?

                            WADE
                  I'd love a blow-job.

                            WEASEL
                  We got that in common.

                            WADE
                  The drink, moose-knuckle.     But first...

     Wade digs in a pocket, slaps the YELLOW `HIT' CARD, the one
     with the CYPRESS TREE, on the bar.

     Weasel goes to the register. Scans the card. Peels off
     three ONE HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS. Lays them out like a bank
     teller. Wade PUSHES the MONEY AWAY...

                            WADE (CONT'D)
                  I ain't taking allowance money. Make
                  sure it gets back to Ms. Osflorsky?
                  Onroflensky? Olly-Olly-Oxen-Free?

                            WEASEL
                  Orlofsky. For a merc, you sure are warm-
                  blooded. Bet you let the boy off easy-
                  peasy, too.

                            WADE
                      (embarrassed)
                  He's not a bad kid, Weas. Just a little
                  light stalking. I was way worse at his
                  age- traveling to far-off places -
                  Baghdad, Mogadishu, Jacksonville -
                      (shudders)
                  - meeting new and exciting people -




                                                                 
                                                                     .
                    
                                                           

                         WEASEL
               And killing them. I've seen your
               Instagram. What was Special Forces doing
               in Jacksonville, anyway?

                         WADE
               Classified.
                   (whispers)
               They have a wonderful TGIFridays. Those
               guys know their way around a Loaded
               Potato Skin. The point is, I'm trying to
               put those days in my rear-view.

     Weasel puts the finishing touches on the drink, pushes it
     across the bar to Wade.

                         WEASEL
               Kahlua, Bailey's, whip cream.        Fellatio
               in a glass.

     A burst of laughter turns Wade's attention to BUCK, a BAD-ASS
     in a snakeskin jacket, has a crowd gathered round him, mid-
     story. He too is holding a YELLOW CARD with SIM and CYPRESS
     TREE.

                         BUCK
               So he's staring at my Glock in his mouth,
               like...
                   (mouth full)
               `I thought you guys had a code!' And I'm
               like, `Yeah, no kids. No women. Almost
               fooled by your tits. But the moustache?!

     The crowd CRACKS UP.

     Wade pulls out Gavin Merchant's wallet and teases out a
     TWENTY. He grabs a passing waitress, tucks the bill in her
     shirt pocket and sets the blowjob on her tray.

                         WADE
               Kelly, you mind taking this over to Buck?
               Tell him it's from Boothe.
                   (whispers, to Weasel)
               Little foreplay.

     Weasel follows Wade's gaze to the end of the bar, where a
     chuckling BOOTHE wraps a bandage around the guy's bloody
     hand.

                         WEASEL
               Remind me what good comes of this?




                                                                
                                                                      .
                Deadpool      Final Shooting Script   
                                                            

                         WADE
               I don't take the shits.       I just disturb
               them.

     Weasel allows himself a tiny conspiratorial SMILE.

                                                         SMASH CUT TO:

   INT. SISTER MARGARET'S - NIGHT                                         

     WADE, in medium shot, TEARING UP at the famous Steven Seagal
     bar fight from `OUT FOR JUSTICE' on T.V. as... SMACK...
     BAM... a REAL bar fight goes on - OUT OF FOCUS - behind him.

                         WADE
                   (trailer voice)
               It's a dirty job... but someone's gotta
               take out the garbage.

     Wade finally turns around to watch. BUCK finishes off
     Boothe... then pours the BLOW-JOB on top of him.

     WEASEL grabs a hand mirror, hops over the bar, and crosses to
     Boothe. All the PATRONS fall HUSH as WEASEL holds the mirror
     to Boothe's mouth. Boothe's BREATH FOGS it up.

                         WEASEL
               Still kicking.

     The place `oooooohs.' Near miss. Weasel returns to his
     place behind the bar, looking disappointed.

                         WADE
               Lemme guess. Ya got Boothe in Sister
               Margaret's dead pool.

                             WEASEL
               Um.    See.    About that-

                         WADE
               You did not bet on me to die.
                   (looks up at board,
                    incredulous)
               You bet on me to die.

     Wade leans back and looks up at an ENORMOUS CHALKBOARD
     hanging above the bar: `Sister Margaret's DEAD POOL.'
     Below, a long LIST of NAMES. DOLLAR AMOUNTS to the right of
     the names. More NAMES to the right of the dollars.

     Indeed, `WEASEL' has chosen `WADE.'       Wade looks betrayed.




                                                                 
                                                                       .
                   
                                                                 

                            WADE (CONT'D)
                  Weasel, you're the world's worst friend.
                  Joke's on you. I'm living to . Like
                  those old Quaker biddies on the Today
                  Show. And retiring on my winnings.

                            WEASEL
                  Wait, who did you pick?

     Weasel looks up a the board, where `WADE' has claimed:
     `BIEBER, J.'

                            WADE
                  The Biebs. But I'm probably wrong.
                  Nothing bad ever happens to teen stars
                  who make  mil a year and think they're
                  immune to the pitfalls of addiction and
                  consequence. He'll be fine.
                      (raises shot, yells)
                  Drinks on me, soldiers of fortune!

                              MERCENARIES
                  Hooah!

                            VANESSA
                  Whoa, whoa...

     Wade turns to see a woman on his other side: VANESSA.
     Brunette. Silver-blue eyes. Tank. Tiny jean-shorts.

                            VANESSA (CONT'D)
                  Sure you wanna shoot your whole wad?

     Wade looks Vanessa all the way up and down... then holds up
     his PINKIE.

                              WADE
                  Tight.

     Vanessa raises her own pinkie.         Shakes like a pinkie swear.

                              VANESSA
                  Vanessa.

                            WADE
                  What's a nice place like you doing in a
                  girl like this?

                            BUCK (O.S.)
                  It ain't what she's doing, it's who.

     BUCK walks past and SLAPS Vanessa on the caboose.



                                                                  
                                                                    .
                
                                                          

                         BUCK (CONT'D)
               I'd hit that shit.

     Wade pushes back his stool, stands menacingly.

                         WADE
               Buck, you'd best apologize, before-

     But Vanessa doesn't wait for Wade's chivalry. She blows
     right by him and grabs a fistful of Buck's crotch. Buck
     gasps.

                         WADE (CONT'D)
               Yeah, that.

                         VANESSA
                   (to Buck)
               Say the magic words, Fat Gandalf.

                         BUCK
               I'm sorry! I have no filter between my
               brain and mouth. I'm working on it.

     Wade takes Vanessa's shoulders.

                         WADE
               OK, he apologized... hakuna his tatas...

     Vanessa lets Buck go, turns on Wade.

                         VANESSA
                   (let's go)
               And you-
                   (shakes Wade off)
               Hands off the merchandise.

                         WADE
               Merchandise? So, what, you, uh, bump
               fuzzies for money?

                           VANESSA
               Yup.

                         WADE
               Rough childhood?

                         VANESSA
               Rougher than yours.     Daddy left before I
               was born.

                         WADE
               Daddy left before I was conceived.



                                                               
                                                                     .
                
                                                           

                         VANESSA
               Ever had a cigarette put out on your
               skin?

                         WADE
               I didn't know there was any other place
               to put one out.

                         VANESSA
               I was molested.

                            WADE
               Me too.     Uncle.

                            VANESSA
               Uncles.     They took turns.

                         WADE
               I watched my own birthday party from the
               keyhole of a locked closet, which was
               also my-

                           VANESSA
               Bedroom?    Lucky. I slept in a dishwasher
               box.

                         WADE
               So you had a dishwasher. I didn't know
               sleep. It was pretty much - of ball
               gags, brownie mix, and fun-house mirrors.

                         VANESSA
               Who would do such a thing?

                          WADE
               Hopefully you. Later tonight.
                   (beat)
               And my Uncle Kevin.

     Wade EMPTIES the rest of Gavin's wallet:

                         WADE (CONT'D)
               What can I get for two-hundred-seventy
               three bucks... and a Yogurtland rewards
               card?

     Vanessa shoves the bills into her halter:

                         VANESSA
               About forty-eight minutes of whatever you
               want...
                   (peers at card)
               And a low-fat dessert.


                                                                
                                                                       .
                 Deadpool     Final Shooting Script    
                                                             

     Wade grins at her like a kid on Christmas morning.

   INT.   ARCADE - NIGHT - PAST                                            

     A two-shot of WADE and VANESSA staring at each other, in
     profile. Wade looks really excited.

                          WADE
                Time to put balls... in holes.

     REVERSE ANGLE to reveal two SKEEBALL MACHINES in the ARCADE.
     Wade inserts tokens, and balls CLUNK down.

     Vanessa looks half amused, half weirded out.

                          WADE (CONT'D)
                You said whatever I want.

                          VANESSA
                I get it. You love skeeball.          Apparently
                more than you love vagina.

                          WADE
                Tough call. Just trying to get to know
                the real you... not the plunging-
                necklined, short-shorted, two-dimensional
                sex object peddled by Hollywood.

     Wade slowly turns to CAMERA.      REVERSE ANGLE TO his P.O.V.:

     A ten-year-old BOY stops in his tracks, his gaze moving from
     Vanessa's plunging neckline to her short shorts.

                             BOY
                Nice tits!

                          VANESSA
                Thank you, son.
                    (tousles boy's hair)
                You know how to make a woman feel
                special.

     Vanessa reaches down, grabs two balls, hands one to Wade.

                          VANESSA (CONT'D)
                Balls in holes.

                          WADE
                Prepare to lose tragically.

                          VANESSA
                Bring it, big man.



                                                                  
                                                                       .
                   
                                                                 

     Wade smiles slyly, sizes up the ramp, rears back and
     OVERHANDS the first ball... right into the , CUP.

                              VANESSA (CONT'D)
                  Ruh-roh.

   INT.   ARCADE PRIZE COUNTER - LATER - PAST                              

     A beaming WADE bellies up to the prize counter and lays a
     massive armful of pink TICKETS on top.

                            WADE
                  The limited edition Voltron: Defender of
                  the Universe ring, por favor.

                             TEEN
                  You're roughly three hundred thousand
                  tickets short.
                      (beat)
                  It's nickel-silver-plated.

                            WADE
                      (disappointed)
                  Then I guess the tire-grade rubber
                  Voltron keychain.

     VANESSA places a measly TEN tickets of her own next to them.

                            VANESSA
                  And the... pencil eraser.

     The weary TEEN behind the counter hands Wade the low-rent
     VOLTRON KEYCHAIN, and Vanessa the eraser.

                            TEEN
                      (reads keychain package
                       copy, bows)
                  You are now the sworn protector of the
                  gentle people of the planet Arus...

                  And you... you can... erase stuff...
                  written in pencil.

     Wade extends his arm chivalrously:

                              WADE
                  M'lady?

                            VANESSA
                  Unfortunately, my anus-loving friend,
                  your forty-eight minutes are up.

                  King Zarkon himself.

     Wade rubs his keychain wistfully, then offers it up.

                            WADE (CONT'D)
                  How many more minutes for this?
                      (hard sell)
                  FYI. Five mini lion-bots come together
                  to make up the super-bot.

                            VANESSA

                  Five mini lion-bots?!
                      (matter-of-fact)
                  Three minutes.

                            WADE

                  That's all I'll need!

                              VANESSA
                  Cuddle?

     Vanessa smiles and takes Wade's arm.        They walk out of the
     ARCADE affectionately...

     ...to the SOUNDS OF TIRELESS, ATHLETIC SEX.

     DUCT TAPE fails to cover a big multi-fissured CRACK in the
     WINDOW of Wade's CRAPPY APARTMENT. Inside, WADE has VANESSA
     up against the wall decorated with CHRISTMAS LIGHTS that have
     overstayed their welcome and a CALENDAR. They are going at
     it like RABBITS.

                            WADE

     between WADE and VANESSA, identified by various holidays.

     VALENTINE'S DAY SEX. WADE falls back onto a bed covered in
     rose petals with VANESSA on top of him. She has drawn a
     heart on his chest in red lipstick. They go at it hard...
     then pause for a romantic look and kiss.

                            VANESSA
                  Happy Valentine's Day...

     Wade girds himself, then lets out a surprised, WHIMPERY YELP
     as some pioneering object journeys into his virgin lands.

   INT.   WADE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - PAST                                

     A CHRISTMAS WREATH hangs on Wade's wall.

                          WADE (O.S.)
                If your left leg is Thanksgiving, and
                your right leg is Christmas...

     WADE strikes a pose, HANDS on HIPS, wearing an AWFUL, AWFUL
     CHRISTMAS SWEATER. And NO PANTS.

     VANESSA sits against the bed's HEADBOARD, SHEET pulled over
     her, up to her chin. She quickly lowers the sheet.
     Revealing an APPALLING CHRISTMAS SWEATER of her own.

                          WADE (CONT'D)
                ...can I visit you between the holidays?

                          VANESSA
                Y'know, red's your color. Brings out the
                bloodshot in your eyes. Christmas gift!
                Catch!

     Vanessa tosses something to Wade.      It lands in his hands.

                          WADE
                Holy fucking shit.

     It's the nickel-silver-plated Voltron RING, all three hundred
     thousand tickets worth.

                          VANESSA
                Limited edition. I had to give the kid
                behind the counter a rub and tug. I'm
                kidding. I'm not kidding. I'm kidding.
                It was nearly five full months of
                Skeeball.

                            VANESSA
                Really.

                            WADE
                  ...about why we're so good together.

                            VANESSA
                  Why's that?

                               WADE
                  Your crazy    matches my crazy. We're like
                  two jigsaw    pieces... weird curvy edges...
                  but fit us    together, you can see the
                  picture on    top.

     Wade plants a kiss on Vanessa.         She sits up on her knees.

                             VANESSA
                  Hey, I've been meaning to ask you, only
                  `cause you haven't gotten around to
                  asking me-
                      (pregnant pause)
                  Wade, will you-

            VANESSA (CONT'D)                              WADE
     Stick it in my-?                       Marry me?

                            VANESSA
                  Uhh... jinx?

     Wade reaches back and pulls out an ENGAGEMENT-RING-LIKE BOX.
     Vanessa can barely contain her excitement.

                            VANESSA (CONT'D)
                  You're not wearing pants. Where exactly
                  were you hiding that?

     A vulnerable Wade hands her the box and stands there with the
     look of... `Open it. Open it!'

                            WADE
                  They say one month's salary.

     Vanessa opens the box... to reveal a CANDY RING.

                            WADE (CONT'D)
                  Slow month. I've been waiting for this
                  day like Boss Hogg waits to get to the
                  crazy cheesy crust...

                               VANESSA

                               WADE
                  I do.

                         VANESSA
               That's my line. I love you, Wade Wilson.

                         WADE
               Thought you charged extra for that.

                           VANESSA
               I did.    At my old job.

                         WADE
               So that's a-?

     Vanessa stares. Swallows. Pulls him back into bed and
     WHISPERS ONE SILENT WORD into his ear ('Yes'). Wade jumps up
     and DANCES around the room all goofy, POP, LOCK, & ROBOT.

                           VANESSA
               Easy.    I can take it back.

     Wade dives back into bed, SPOONS with Vanessa, wrapping her
     in his ARMS, touching his cheek to hers.

                         WADE
               What if I never let go?

                         VANESSA
               Just rode a bitch's back, like Yoda on
               Luke?

                         WADE
                   (contented sigh)
               `Star Wars' jokes?!

                         VANESSA
                   (corrects)
               `Empire.'

                         WADE
               It's like I made you in a computer.

     Wade swoons, reaches, grabs a POLAROID CAMERA off his night-
     stand, and holds it at arm's length.

                         WADE (CONT'D)
                   (Yoda voice)
               Cheese, say!

     The flash POPS.    For this one moment, his life is...

                           WADE (CONT'D)
               Perfect.

     Wade hands Vanessa the photo.    Then...


                                                               
                                                                      .
                 
                                                            

                             WADE (CONT'D)
                Wee break.

     ...bounces up to go to the BATHROOM. Vanessa gazes at the
     photo, which is already FADING IN. Wade notices.

                          WADE (CONT'D)
                Shake it like a- Uh. You get it.

                          DEADPOOL (V.O.)
                Here's the thing. Life is an endless
                series of train-wrecks with only brief,
                commercial-like breaks of happiness.
                This had been the ultimate commercial
                break. Which meant it was time to
                return...

     Wade peels off his Christmas sweater... and STEPS CONFIDENTLY
     BACK TOWARD THE BED. But before he gets there...

                          DEADPOOL (V.O.)
                ...to our regularly scheduled program.

     ...HE PASSES OUT, FACE-PLANTING ONTO THE FLOOR.

   INT.   ONCOLOGY WARD - DAY - PAST                                      

     WADE is sitting in a doctor's office, VANESSA by his side,
     opposite a solemn ONCOLOGIST. Every image suggests BAD NEWS:

     A COMPLEX looking MRI IMAGE of the CIRCULATORY SYSTEM on a
     BACKLIT VIEWING TABLE. SWEAT STAINS under Wade's arms.
     Vanessa GRIPPING his hand. The LOOK on the DOCTOR's FACE.

                          WADE
                You're clowning.     You're not clowning?        I
                sense clowns.

                          DOCTOR
                People react to news of late-stage cancer
                differently.

     Wade and Vanessa turn and share a devastated but loving look.

                          VANESSA
                    (to doctor, springs into
                     action)
                So what do we do? Surely there's
                something... we can... do. I mean, my
                uncle, he was diagnosed with thyroid
                cancer, and there was this new
                experimental drug that-



                                                                 
                                                                      .
                   
                                                                

     The VOLUME of Vanessa's voice FADES until we can SEE her
     talking but no longer hear the words:

                            DEADPOOL (V.O.)
                  See, people do react differently.
                  Vanessa's already working on Plan A. B.
                  All the way to Z. Me? I'm memorizing
                  the details of her face. Like it's the
                  first time I'm seeing it. Or the last.

                            DOCTOR (O.S.)
                  Mr. Wilson?

                            DEADPOOL (V.O.)
                  Believe it or not, this is only the ninth
                  shittiest thing that's ever happened to
                  me.

                            DOCTOR (O.S.)
                  Mr. Wilson?

                            DEADPOOL (V.O.)
                  Stick around. Number  is coming right
                  up.

                            DOCTOR
                  Take your time to process this.

   EXT.   FREEWAY - DAY                                                   

     DEADPOOL HAS AJAX PINNED TO THE FREEWAY RAIL.

                            DEADPOOL
                  You know how many people I've killed to
                  find you?

                            AJAX
                  Actually, I do.

                             DEADPOOL
                  So you're aware I've been waiting a long,
                  long time for this. And now I'm finally
                  gonna...
                      (ALT:)
                  So you're aware of the category  fuck-
                  storm that's coming.
                      (ALT:)
                  Then you know what's coming. I'm about
                  to do to you what Sugar Ray did to the
                  mid-nineties.

     A massive SHADOW passes over AJAX and DEADPOOL, accompanied
     by LOUD METALLIC FOOTSTEPS. Ajax looks up, a bit awed.


                                                                 
                                                                       .
                   
                                                                 

     Deadpool senses something, reaches back with one hand,
     feels...

     ...what turns out to be Colossus's METALLIC CROTCH.

                              DEADPOOL (CONT'D)
                  Dad?

     COLOSSUS GRABS Deadpool's WRIST, CHUCKS him THROUGH the AIR,
     ASS OVER TEAKETTLE.

   INT.   WADE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - LATER - PAST                          

     A CLOSE-UP of a Deadpool ACTION FIGURE from `X-Men Origins.'
     Mouth sewn shut. Blades implanted into wrists.

     In the exact same POSE we just saw the real Deadpool.
     Sitting in a nightstand DRAWER in Wade's apartment.

                            WADE (O.S.)
                  This is my most prized possession.

     Wade looks like he's reaching into the drawer for the action
     figure, but instead, reaches just UNDER it to grasp Wham!'s
     `Make it Big' album on Vinyl. He pulls out the album.

                              VANESSA
                  Wham?

                            WADE
                  Wham!
                      (cradles album lovingly)
                  `Make it Big' was the album George and
                  Andy earned their exclamation point.

     Wade places the album carefully into one of two OPEN
     SUITCASES on the floor next to him. He is currently going
     through his possessions, TOSSING OUT the crap and placing the
     good stuff into the suitcases.

     Wade pulls out the action figure.

                            WADE (CONT'D)
                  But this. A little piece of me died the
                  day this came out...

     Wade DUNKS the action figure in the trash can.         VANESSA
     stands opposite, arms crossed, FUMING.

                            VANESSA
                  So I'm s'posed to just... smile and wave
                  you out the door?



                                                                  
                                                                      .
                   
                                                                

                            WADE
                  Think of it as a spring cleaning. Only
                  if spring was death.
                      (pulls out BERNADETTE PETERS
                       CHANGE PURSE)
                  If I had a nickel for every time I
                  spanked it to Bernadette Peters.
                      (opens purse, it's full of
                       nickels)
                  Looks like I do.

     Wade TOSSES the purse toward one of the suitcases.           Vanessa's
     hand stabs out and GRABS it.

                            VANESSA
                  Bernadette's not going anywhere.
                      (slam-dunks purse back into
                       drawer)
                  `Cause you're not going anywhere.

                            WADE
                  Right! The tumors are only in my liver,
                  lungs, prostate, and brain. All the
                  things you can live without.

                            VANESSA
                  You know what I mean. You belong here at
                  home. Surrounded by your Voltron... and
                  your Bernadette... and your me.

                            WADE
                  Babe, we've been through this! Cancer's
                  a real shit-show. A Yakov-Smirnoff-
                  opening-for-the-Spin-Doctors-at-the-Iowa-
                  State-Fair shit-show. And under no
                  circumstances will I take you to that
                  show. I want you to remember me me.

                            VANESSA
                  Well, I want to remember us us.
                      (that doesn't sound right)
                  We we?

                            WADE
                  I swear, I'll find you in the next life.
                  And boom-box `Careless Whisper' under
                  your window. Wham!

                            VANESSA
                  Are you gonna keep saying it like that?
                  Look, I get this impulse. I do.
                            (MORE)
                          VANESSA (CONT'D)
                Before I met you, I used to fantasize
                about dying alone in the woods, torn
                apart by wolves.

                          WADE
                Super fucking bad-ass.

                          VANESSA
                But that was then, and this is now. Walk
                out that door. I dare you. I will ride
                you out. And I won't let go. Yoda on
                Luke.

     Vanessa embraces Wade. Tight.        Won't let go.   A TEAR
     trickles down Vanessa's CHEEK.

                          VANESSA (CONT'D)
                    (into Wade's ear)
                If you're willing to fight. There are
                still options. We'll find them.
                Together.

                          WADE
                    (smiles)
                I just realized! I win! My life's
                officially more fucked-up than yours.

                          VANESSA
                No one's boom-boxing shit.

     Vanessa interlaces her pinkie with Wade's.      Smiles.

                          VANESSA (CONT'D)
                What do we we have to lose?

                            WADE
                Nothing.    Everything.

     Vanessa leans in, and the two start to KISS.

   INT.   BEDROOM - NIGHT - PAST                                         

     VANESSA, horizontal, limbs akimbo, ASLEEP in bed.          She stirs,
     feels next to her for Wade. He's NOT THERE.

     REVEAL WADE standing at the bedroom window. His P.O.V. of
     the moon makes it look FRACTURED by the cracked glass.

     RACK FOCUS to Vanessa's REFLECTION. She, too, looks
     fractured. Wade's eyes well with TEARS at the sight of her.
     Cancer will steal the one thing that ever mattered.

     Vanessa's cracked reflection suddenly RAISES its HEAD.


                                                                
                                                                        .
                     
                                                                  

                              WADE
                    Sorry. Liam Neeson nightmare. I
                    kidnapped his daughter, and he just
                    wasn't having it.

       Wade slides back into bed.

                              WADE (CONT'D)
                    They've made three of those movies. At
                    some point you wonder if he's just a bad
                    parent.

       Wade lies on his back. Vanessa nestles her head lovingly
       against his chest. He takes a vulnerable look at her, then
       stares at the ceiling, LOST.

RS   INT.   APARTMENT - NIGHT                                           RS

       Wade slips quietly out of bed...

       ...slips on a hoodie and a backpack...

       ...opens the door... takes one last longing look at
       Vanessa...

       ...and slips into the hallway, closing the door behind him.

       Vanessa is left to feel for Wade in the dark.

A    EXT.   STREET - NIGHT                                                  A

       WADE walks down the street into the night.

       He pulls a crumpled card from his jacket pocket:        the black
       card with the recruiter's number.

       Still walking, Wade pulls out a cellphone and dials.

     INT.   SISTER MARGARET'S - NIGHT - PAST                                

       Just another night at SISTER MARGARET'S WAYWARD SCHOOL FOR
       GIRLS. Regular crowd has shuffled in. Tonight, a bit thin.

       WADE is bellied up to the bar, disheveled, unkempt, and
       distraught. WEASEL leans in:

                              WEASEL
                    Jesus. Someone needs a blow-job and a
                    shower. Though courtesy calls for the
                    latter first.




                                                                   
                                                                     .
                   
                                                               

                            WADE
                  Three shots of Patron Silver, Weez.     And
                  a cure to terminal cancer.

                            WEASEL
                      (hands over a green
                       concoction)
                  Fresh out of Patron. Wheatgrass?

                            WADE
                  You're starting to sound like Vanessa...

     With SHAKY HANDS, Wade empties his POCKETS, placing CRUMPLED
     BROCHURES on the bar.

                            WADE (CONT'D)
                  She sent away for all these colorful
                  clinic brochures. I hear Chechnya's nice
                  this time of... never. Then there's
                  China... Central Mexico... Know how they
                  say `Cancer' in Spanish? Â¡El CÃ¡ncer.'

     Wade pulls out one last thing from his pockets: A POLAROID
     of HIMSELF and VANESSA. He stares. Weasel notices.

                            WEASEL
                  This belongs on the wall. I want to
                  remember you when you looked... alive.

     Wade scrapes up a smile as Weasel tapes the picture to the
     BIG BAR MIRROR. Weasel pours a second wheatgrass shot.
     Clinks Wade's glass. They throw them back. WINCE.

                            WEASEL (CONT'D)
                  Almost forgot...

     Weasel slides Wade a distinctive black BUSINESS CARD across
     the bartop.

                            WEASEL (CONT'D)
                  Guy came in asking for you.     Real Grim
                  Reaper type.

     Wade's gaze follows Weasel's gesture across the barroom,
     where an ominous MAN in a BLACK SUIT sits ALONE at a table.

                            WEASEL (CONT'D)
                  I don't know? May further the plot?

                                                                 CUT TO:

A   INT.   SISTER'S MARGARET'S - NIGHT - PAST                             A

      WADE dead-man-walks to the back of the bar. He passes BOOTHE
      and BEEF on his way. They nod solemnly, like cops at a
      funeral procession honoring one of their own.

                             BEEF
                 Wade.

      Beef offers Wade his shot. Wade eeks out a smile. Throws it
      back. Then continues on. Wade stops next to the MAN's
      TABLE.

                           WADE
                 Forget your scythe?

      The man, even creepier from close up, SMILES.

                           RECRUITER
                 Mr. Wilson. Have a seat.
                     (Wade sits, long pause)
                 I understand you've recently been
                 diagnosed with terminal cancer.

                           WADE
                 Stalker alert.

                           RECRUITER
                 It's my job. Recruitment. And you have
                 quite a reputation. I'm sorry you've had
                 a tough go. But you're a fighter. And
                 not just for Johnny Canuck, impressive as
                 your stint in special forces was. Forty-
                 one confirmed kills?

                           WADE
                     (bitter)
                 One every seven weeks.     Same rate most
                 folks get a hair-cut.

      Wade grabs the recruiter's drink and throws it back.

                           WADE (CONT'D)
                 To wash the taste out. It's hard to
                 forget being so... impressive.

                           RECRUITER
                 Now you spend your days sticking up for
                 the little man, slitting small time
                 throats for small time folks.

                           WADE
                 People change.

      The recruiter leans uncomfortably close.

                             RECRUITER
                       (low, conspiratorial)
                   Speaking of which... Mr. Wilson, I
                   represent an organization that may be
                   able to help. What if I told you we can
                   cure your cancer? And what's more, give
                   you abilities most men only dream of?

                             WADE
                   I'd say you sound like an infomercial.
                   And not a good infomercial, like Slap
                   Chop. More Shake-Weighty.
                       (jack-off motion)

                             RECRUITER
                   The world needs extraordinary men. We
                   won't just make you better. We'll make
                   you better than better. A super-hero.

                             WADE
                   I already tried the hero business. Let's
                   just say it left a mark. The only chance
                   you'll see me again is if I hit `fuck-
                   it.'

    EXT./INT.    GUADALAJARAN CLINIC WAITING ROOM - DAY - PAST           

      A DILAPIDATED, SKETCHY MEDICAL `CLINIC' haunts the cityscape
      in GUADALAJARA, MEXICO.

                             WADE (V.O.)
                   For now, I'll get through this with the
                   one I love.

      A sickly-looking WADE is on the final stop in his futile
      quest to find a cure. DESPERATE. Among the MOST DESPERATE.

      He sits in a pathetic muzak-filled WAITING ROOM. Wearing a
      SOMBRERO and clutching VANESSA's hand. Her fingers are
      interlaced in his, once perfectly manicured nails chewed to
      the quick.

      Vanessa is also wearing a SOMBRERO, and ANXIETY on her face.

      Wade COUGHS SEVERELY, REPEATEDLY into a HANDKERCHIEF.

      Wade turns to the sweet ELDERLY COUPLE sitting next to him,
      ekes out a smile. The old man plays with some WORRY BEADS.




                                                                  
                                                                        .
                   
                                                                  

                            WADE
                      (pulls out Spanish-English
                       electronic translator)
                  De donde eres?

                            ELDERLY WOMAN
                  Boca Raton.

                             WADE
                  Ah.   The fancy part of Mexico.

                            ELDERLY MAN
                  We've moved in with my son.       To afford
                  the treatment.

     Wade looks pained to hear this.

                               WADE
                  Cancer?     Sorry - Â¿El CÃ¡ncer?

                            ELDERLY MAN
                  Stage four.

                            WADE
                  Toughest part of the Tour de France.

                            VANESSA
                  Very hilly.

     The elderly man gestures to the souvenir PATCHES sewn onto
     Wade's `HELLO KITTY' DUFFEL: CHECHNYA. CHINA. INDONESIA.

                            ELDERLY MAN
                  Logging some frequent flier miles?

                            WADE
                      (bone-weary)
                  Final stop on Desperation World Tour,
                  , which I believe was also the name
                  of the Stones' last concert...

                            VANESSA
                  `Final' because this is where we find the
                  cure.

     A MOTHER and her stoic young SON sign in with the NURSE
     behind the front desk. The boy has lost all his HAIR.

                             NURSE
                  No cheques de viajero.      No pesos.   Cash.
                  Americano.




                                                                   
                                                              .
                
                                                    

     Wade grows upset as the mother counts out hard-earned CASH.
     The boy reaches for a BOX filled with CHUPACHUPS (lollipops).
     The nurse scolds:

                         NURSE (CONT'D)
               Chupachups cuestan extra!

                         WADE (O.S.)
                   (angry)
               Hey!

     The nurse looks coldly at Wade. He stares back, eyes hard,
     then gets up and lays a crumpled dollar on the counter.

                         WADE (CONT'D)
                   (ice cold)
               It's on me.

     The nurse blinks, then stands, checking a CHART.

                         NURSE
               SeÃ±or... Abe Solomon?

     ABE and his WIFE get up. The nurse motions for Mrs. Solomon
     to stay in the waiting room.

                         ABE
                   (to Wade and Vanessa)
               Handsome couple. Good luck to you two.

     Abe drops his WORRY BEADS. Wade bends to retrieve them, then
     stands with effort and gently hands them to Abe.

                         WADE
               Good luck to you, Pops.

     Wade sits back down, and his eyes find the LITTLE BOY: his
     SUNKEN EYES. His MISSING HAIR. His LOLLIPOP, CLUTCHED like
     the richest treasure.

     Wade turns to look at Vanessa, who's also staring at the boy.

     Even though Vanessa is healthy, she, too, looks sick. No
     makeup. Dirty hair. Dark circles under her eyes. When she
     looks at Wade, it's clear she, not he, most needs comfort.

     Wade pulls Vanessa close and strokes her hair with a
     trembling hand. Abe disappears. Wade watches with a newly
     dark look of suspicion.
                                                                      .
                 



   INT.   OPERATING ROOM - DAY - PAST                                     

     ABE lies shirtless on an UNSANITARY operating table, a tray
     of RUSTY surgical KNIVES nearby.

     A MAN with a pock-marked face stands over him in a white lab
     coat with blue-stitched cursive writing: `Dr. Delgado.'

                          DOCTOR
                Buenos dÃ­as, SeÃ±or Abe.

     `Doctor' Delgado pokes and prods with his fingers, as if
     Abe's mid-section is Play-Doh.

                          DOCTOR (CONT'D)
                Voy a llegar dentro de tu cuerpo.

                             ABE
                I'm sorry.     No hablo espaÃ±ol, doc.

     The doctor's other hand dips below the table, comes up
     dripping with something bloody. He kneeds at wrinkled skin
     smearing the CHICKEN BLOOD across Abe's flesh.

                          DOCTOR
                De que se cure! SeÃ±or Abe, you are
                cured.

     The doctor holds SMELLING SALTS under Abe's nose. His closed
     eyes jerk open to see the doctor's gloved hand CLUTCHING a
     huge, bloody `TUMOR.'

     Abe pushes himself up, peers down at his bloody abdomen with
     awe. The doctor wipes the blood away and helps him up.

                          ABE
                    (tearing up)
                Thank you. I owe you my life.

     As Abe shuffles out, the doctor turns away to dump the
     `tumor' in the trash and wash his bloody hands in a basin.

                          DOCTOR
                    (over his shoulder)
                Â¡Proximo! Next!

                          WADE (O.S.)
                Already here, hombre.

     Dr. Delgado nearly JUMPS at the sight of WADE, already
     standing in the OPEN DOOR of the room, looking DANGEROUS.




                                                                 
                                                                      .
                   
                                                                

                            DOCTOR
                  So sorry, you surprise me. How...
                  long... you standing there, SeÃ±or?

     Wade walks slowly TOWARD the doctor, who steps out nervously
     from BEHIND his table. The two stand face-to-face. Wade
     smiles... angles his foot UNDER the OPERATING TABLE...

     ...and uses it to SLIDE something out from underneath the
     table: a BUCKET of BLOODY CHICKEN GIZZARDS that double as
     removed `tumors.' Wade's RAGE seems to grow by the INSTANT.

                            WADE
                  Long enough...

     Delgado senses he is suddenly in danger, picks up a rusty
     SCALPEL from his tray. Wade moves toward him. Delgado
     LUNGES, He STABS WADE in the shoulder, then RUNS.

     Wade TACKLES him. In Wade's weakened state, the fight
     becomes an intense STRUGGLE. The two FALL and WRESTLE. The
     BUCKET of GIZZARDS overturns. They roll around in slop.

     The doctor squirms out of Wade's grasp and crawls into the
     hallway. Wade wriggles after him, tugging at his ankle.

     The MUZAC still plays. VANESSA smiles warmly/sadly at the
     little BOY, who is unwrapping his CHUPACHUP.

     Suddenly... a SCREAM and cries for help in Spanish. The
     NURSE and an ALARMED VANESSA rush toward the shouting.

   INT.   HALLWAY - SUNSET - PAST                                         

     At last, WADE's fury has overcome his physical weakness. He
     straddles the DOCTOR's CHEST. His expression is that of a
     man who's LOSING his SHIT.

     Wade RAISES THE SCALPEL, SLASHES at the doctor's throat, then
     STABS him in the heart. The doctor writhes, spasms, gurgles,
     and falls still.

     Chest heaving, Wade raises his head to see... at the FAR END
     of the HALL:

     VANESSA - frozen, TERRIFIED. A blood-soaked Wade locks eyes
     with her and swims back up into SANITY... `What have I done?'
     This is a horrific glimpse into Wade's murderous past...

     ...and the look on Vanessa's face is one of HORROR and PAIN.



                                                                 
                                                                      .
                   
                                                                

     Awash in shame, Wade staggers to his feet, slips on chicken
     blood, and LUNGES in the other direction. He hits the door
     at the end of the hall at a RUN.

   STAB!                                                                  

     The sword, covered in BLOOD, penetrates the crayon drawing of
     the recruiter on DEADPOOL's CORKBOARD.

                            DEADPOOL
                  Thank you, Agent Smith.

     Deadpool lasers in on AJAX's picture at the top of the
     pyramid.

   EXT.    GUADALAJARA STREET - SUNSET - PAST                             

     WADE leans against a wall, gasping for breath. He looks back
     toward her voice, face a mask of pain. Instead of seeking
     her... he melts into the busy street.

   EXT.    DEADPOOL'S LAIR - DAY                                          

     DEADPOOL trudges to his FRONT DOOR.       He speaks to the
     AUDIENCE:

                            DEADPOOL
                  Some kind of anger can't be managed.
                  Like the kind where your year-long plan
                  ends with the wrong guy getting
                  dismembered! That said... when it comes
                  time to licking wounds... there's no
                  place like home, and I share that home
                  with someone you met, the old blind lady
                  from the laundromat, Al. She's like
                  Robin to my Batman. Except she's old.
                  And black. And blind.

     POPS INSIDE

                            DEADPOOL (V.O.)
                  And I think she loves me. Wait... pretty
                  sure Robin loves Batman, too.

   INT.    WORKSHOP - NIGHT - PAST                                        

     WADE, ghastly, nearing death, lies BACK onto a STRETCHER,
     covered only by a FLIMSY HOSPITAL GOWN. He's being wheeled
     down a dim corridor by two tough-looking ORDERLIES.

     In one hand, he holds the recruiter's crumpled BUSINESS CARD.
     In the other, he clutches the limited edition VOLTRON RING,
     as tight as his shaky hand allows.


                                                                 
                                                                        .
                   
                                                                  

     They turn a corner and push through a pair of double doors
     into a cavernous room. Wade looks around, full of hope for a
     new life. Immediately, every single thing he sees/hears
     begins to erode his confidence. The RECRUITER stands just
     inside the doors, smiling.

                            RECRUITER (O.S.)
                  Mr. Wilson! Nothing warms my heart like
                  a change of someone else's.

     Walking into Wade's P.O.V. is the creepy RECRUITER.             He beams
     down on Wade.

                            RECRUITER (CONT'D)
                  You finally hit `fuck-it.'

                            WADE
                  Worse.  Just promise you'll do right by
                  me. So I can do right by someone else.

                               RECRUITER
                  Of course.

                            WADE
                  Oh, and please don't make my super suit
                  green. Or animated.

                            RECRUITER
                  I hope you enjoy your stay.

     The `Workshop,' as this old warehouse is affectionately
     called, has been converted into a working LABORATORY.

     Wade is wheeled through a vast room containing rows of
     individual `tents,' each containing a SUBJECT. Wade's eyes
     DART to helpless SILHOUETTES.

     We hear WHISPERS, WHIMPERS, MOANS.

     A FELLOW PATIENT, a pathetic, terrified little man named
     CUNNINGHAM, is wheeled past Wade, restrained on another
     STRETCHER. Cunningham briefly locks eyes with Wade, but
     quickly moves on by.

     Wade can't help but be alarmed by the TERROR in Cunningham's
     eyes.

     The tents are illuminated by BLINDING overhead lights.             Wade
     spies GRUESOMELY INTIMIDATING MEDICAL EQUIPMENT.

     Wade is wheeled into the tent that's his new home. The
     FIGURE who was pushing Wade DUMPS him onto a CHROME OPERATING
     TABLE and roughly STRAPS him down.


                                                                   
                                                                   .
                
                                                         

                         WADE
               Um.  My first request?    A warmer table.
                   (shivers)
               And warmer hands.

     Wade DOUBLE-TAKES at the sight of the figure above him:
     ANGEL DUST - thirties, female, tall, sexy, athletic - an
     Amazonian warrior in another age.

     Angel Dust wheels over a high-tech I.V. DRIP, complete with
     glass cylindrical tanks housing a glowing, viscous LIQUID.

     Then she roughly straps Wade's NECK to the table. Wade
     nearly GASPS, the color now officially drained from his face.

                          WADE (CONT'D)
               Easy!   Aren't you a little strong for a
               lady?   I'm calling wang.

                         ANGEL DUST
               You'd like that, huh.    Welcome to our
               little hospital.

                         WADE
               It doesn't look like a hospital. It
               looks like Chlamydia holding still.

     An UNLIT MATCHSTICK protrudes from Angel Dust's teeth - her
     idea of a TOOTHPICK.

                         WADE (CONT'D)
               Oral fixation?

                          ANGEL DUST
               Shut.   The fuck. Up.

     Angel Dust places a FINGER on Wade's FOREHEAD and SHOVES his
     head back against the table - BANG - pinning it there.

                         AJAX (O.S.)
               Patience, Angel. All in good time.

     Enter AJAX, whom we know as the PRISONER from the RAFT with
     whom we've seen Deadpool tangle in the PRESENT. This is the
     first Ajax and Wade have met.

                         WADE
               Can I expect turndown serv-?

     Ajax nods to Angel Dust. BOOM! She GAGS Wade with SURGICAL
     TUBING, then wraps it around the TABLE, immobilizing his
     head.



                                                              
                                                                   .
                
                                                         

                         AJAX
               You're a talker.

     Wade's eyes are wider than ever.    WTF?

                         AJAX (CONT'D)
                   (disarmingly matter-of-fact)
               Mr. Wilson, my name is Ajax. I manage
               the Workshop. My `welcome' speech used
               to be full of euphemisms like `You may
               feel some discomfort.' But I've grown
               blunt.

     Ajax unsheathes an I.V. NEEDLE. Angel Dust up-tilts the
     table  degrees, then readies a holographic monitor.

                         AJAX (CONT'D)
               The Workshop is not a government program.
               It's a private institution tasked with
               turning reclamation projects like
               yourself into men of extraordinary
               abilities. I'm about to remake your
               life. But if you think cancer cures
               painlessly, you're wrong. If you think
               super-human powers are acquired
               painlessly, you're wrong.

     Ajax touches Wade with the I.V. NEEDLE, pressing here and
     there, not QUITE hard enough to break skin. At last, he
     locates the subclavian vein. Wade flinches.

                         AJAX (CONT'D)
               We're injecting you with a serum that
               activates mutant genes. For it to work,
               we need to subject you to extreme stress.

     The liquid glows FLUORESCENT through Wade's white skin as it
     pumps into the pulmonary highway.

                          AJAX (CONT'D)
               You've heard the whole make-an-omelette,
               break-some-eggs bit?
                   (Wade blinks)
               I'm about to hurt you, Wade. The kind of
               hurt I can't describe and you can't
               prepare for. It's cruel stuff. And
               there's no way out for you. No secret
               you can tell me. No soft spot in me to
               appeal to.

     Wade stares at them in shock.




                                                              
                                                                .
                
                                                      

                         ANGEL DUST
               What, you expected Weapon X?

     Ajax starts to TURN AWAY, but stops.

                          AJAX
               One more thing. What's the ad? `I'm not
               just the president. I'm a client?' I've
               been through this procedure myself. It
               made me stronger. It also scorched my
               nerve endings. So I no longer feel pain.
               In fact...
                   (smiles)
               I no longer feel anything.

     Wade reacts by SAYING something - made UNINTELLIGIBLE by the
     surgical tubing. Ajax nods to Angel Dust, who slices the
     SURGICAL TUBING, SNAPPING it away and FREEING Wade to TALK.

                         WADE
               Something in your teeth.

     Ajax smiles WITHOUT opening his mouth, signals Angel Dust.
     She slams Wade's head back again as he turns to leave.

     Before he exits, Ajax hesitates, can't help but check his
     teeth in one of the surgical mirrors.

                         WADE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
               Made you look! Hey, is Ajax your real
               name? `Cause it sounds suspiciously made
               up. What's it really? Steve? Mark?
               Trevor? Kyle?
                   (E.T. voice)
               Elliot?

     We hear LAUGHS from nearby tents.      Wade is now playing for an
     audience.

                         AJAX
               Joke away. The one thing that never
               survives this place is a sense of humor.

                            WADE
               We'll see!

                          AJAX
                   (to Angel Dust)
               All yours.

     We re-take WADE'S P.O.V. as Angel Dust, chewing her
     matchstick, re-enters frame above him, smiles, then punches
     him in the face. Black.
                                                                        .
                     



     INT.   WORKSHOP - NIGHT/DAY - MONTAGE - PAST                           

       A MONTAGE of Wade's treatments in the Workshop, set to the
       notes of JOHN DENVER's inspirational classic, `I WANT TO
       LIVE.' Juxtaposed with HARROWING VIGNETTES of Angel Dust and
       AJAX experimenting on WADE...

       ...as he GASPS, CLAWS, SCREAMS BLOODY MURDER.

       Wade is DUNKED into thick, molasses-like LIQUID. PULLED and
       YANKED, POKED and PRODDED by contraptions that would have
       shamed the Spanish Inquisition.

       SAWED.   COMPRESSED.     SLICED.   DICED.   SLAP-CHOPPED.     BLED.

       LONG SYRINGES PLUNGE DEEP INTO SOFT TISSUE.

       SCALPELS MAKE LONG INCISIONS.

       ENDOSCOPIC CAMERAS TRAVEL THROUGH THE BODY, REVEALING THE
       DIRTY WORK OF INVASIVE SURGICAL EQUIPMENT.

       STAPLE-GUNS DRIVE STAPLES INTO SLICED SKIN TO PULL IT BACK
       TOGETHER.

       MINIATURE CIRCULAR SAWS SLICE THROUGH BONE.

       IV's PULL FLUIDS FROM THE BODY AND INSERT OTHER FLUIDS IN.

                              JOHN DENVER
                    I want to share what I can give.     I want
                    to be... I want to live!

       We also see SHORT, ULTRA-FAST MINI-MONTAGES of medical
       instruments, implying the PASSAGE of TIME.

     INT.   WORKSHOP - WADE'S TENT / WORM'S TENT - NIGHT                   

       At last, Wade is laid back down on his table, only now in
       QUIET DARKNESS, MEEK, WITHOUT ANY RESISTANCE whatever.

                                CUNNINGHAM (O.S.)
                    Puppies.

       In the tent NEXT to Wade, CUNNINGHAM holds up his FIST to the
       fabric. Wade can see it through the cloth in SILHOUETTE.

                              CUNNINGHAM (CONT'D)
                    It helps picturing puppies.

       Wade gives Cunningham a KNUCKLE BUMP through the fabric.

                                WADE
                    Puppies.

                              CUNNINGHAM
                    Or kittens. If you swing that way.

                              WADE
                        (chuckles)
                    I swing both ways.

       Wade swallows hard, grows serious:

                              WADE (CONT'D)
                    But me, I've been making a list of things
                    I still plan to do.

                              CUNNINGHAM
                    A bucket list?

                  With the mouse ears? Creative, and
                  delicious.

     AJAX and ANGEL DUST enter CUNNINGHAM's tent and begin
     prepping him for a fresh round of torture.

                            AJAX (CONT'D)
                  It's OK, I encourage distractions. Can't
                  have you giving up on us, can we now, you
                  little worm?

     Suddenly, a VOICE calls out from the adjacent tent:

                            WADE (O.S.)
                  Don't take that shit, Cunningham! How
                  tough can he be? Name like Francis.

     Ajax is very subtly SURPRISED.      WHAT did Wade just say?       WADE
     is still strapped down inside.      Talking nice and LOUD:

                            WADE (CONT'D)
                  That's right! He got `Ajax' off a dish-
                  washing liquid!
                      (laughs from nearby tents)
                  Legal name's Francis. F-R-A-N-C-I-oops.

     Ajax has ENTERED Wade's tent. Ajax's expression tells us all
     we need to know about the validity of Wade's claim.

     With as much freedom of motion as he has in one hand, Wade
     WAVES a STUB of PAPER at Francis.

                             WADE (CONT'D)
                  Dry-cleaning tag, Francis.     Snagged it

      CLOSE-UP on the tag, which reads `FREEMAN, FRANCIS.'

      Ajax stares hard at Wade with menacing eyes.

                           AJAX
                 You are so relentlessly annoying. Shut
                 the fuck up, or I'll sew that pretty
                 mouth shut.

                           WADE
                 Uh, I wouldn't do that. Here's the
                 problem with round-the-clock torture.
                 You can't really step it up from there.

                           AJAX
                 Is that what you think?

                            WADE

      Two ORDERLIES and ANGEL DUST finish strapping Wade down and
      attaching ELECTRODES to his head and chest. Wade is BOUND to
      a HOSPITAL BED that's ENCASED in a large CAPSULE of
      PLEXIGLAS.

      The top half of the capsule is hinged to one side, OPEN,
      allowing Angel Dust access to Wade.

      Ajax sits eating a meal from some Tupperware in a nearby
      chair.

                           AJAX

                 We don't even have a name for this next
                 toy.

      Various WIRES and TUBES run out of the capsule, connected to
      OXYGEN TANKS, DIALS, and a MONITOR tracking BRAIN and HEART.

                           AJAX (CONT'D)

                                WADE

                  secret, Wade. The Workshop doesn't make
                  super-heroes. It makes super-slaves.

                  There's a brave face.

     Ajax goes to close the lid.

                            WADE
                  Seriously. Now you do have something in
                  your teeth.

      Ajax swings the capsule CLOSED and LOCKS it. The sound leaks
      away until all that's left is a HISSING SOUND as AJAX hits
      BUTTONS to lower O LEVELS.

      Wade's voice drops out as his breathing suddenly grows SHORT
      and SHALLOW. The oxygen dials fall. His HEART-RATE SOARS.

                           ANGEL DUST
                     (chuckles)
                 He looks like a turd in a punch-bowl.

                 The `Punch-Bowl!'

      Wade fights off panic. His breaths become desperate GASPS.
      There's not enough air to talk, or even SCREAM.

                                                         DISSOLVE TO:

      Night.   Eerily DARK, SILENT.

      An extreme CLOSE-UP of Wade's hand, nails clenched into the
      surface of whatever he's lying on. Is his skin... actually
      BUBBLING?

      Two MEN enter the tent and stand over the PUNCH-BOWL.

      CLICK. One of the men turns on a surgical light overhead,
      revealing himself to be a KINDLY-looking DOCTOR, avuncular,
      thick glasses. Next to him is an ORDERLY. The doctor peers
      through the Punch-Bowl's lid. He is SURPRISED by what he
      sees. He nods to the orderly: `Go on, hurry.'

      The orderly quickly unlocks and unlatches the lid, then
      swings it OPEN. Air RUSHES INTO the PUNCH-BOWL. The orderly
      steps away, leaving the doctor alone in the room.

      WADE, hidden in darkness, gasps as though surfacing after
      being held underwater.

      The doctor casts a SHADOW over WADE's face inside.         The
      doctor is FASCINATED, ENLIVENED.

                           DOCTOR
                 Mr. Wilson... these results are
                 remarkable.

      Wade takes deep LUNGS-FUL of AIR.

                             DOCTOR (CONT'D)
                   Your cancer cells are more aggressive
                   than ever. Dividing and metastasizing at
                   a fantastic rate.

                             WADE
                       (broken, breathless)
                   Yippee.

                             DOCTOR
                   But... the cells have inalterably
                   changed. They're no longer destructive,
                   but productive, selectively targeting and
                   replacing damaged tissue.

                             WADE
                   That was a lot of... what's the word...
                   syllables. Are you saying I'm better?

                             DOCTOR
                   Better than better.    A miracle.

                              WADE
                       (weak smile)
                   My Mom used to call me that.

                   Me and Jesus.
                       (beat, to doctor)
                   Thank you. I owe you my life.

      Wade grows choked up. The doctor is taken with empathy and
      affection. He tenderly brushes the hair off Wade's forehead,
      of which the camera catches the tiniest glimpse. Wade's skin
      is not RIGHT somehow.

                             DOCTOR
                   There. There. Your journey's been long
                   and difficult. But you've become
                   something extraordinary. Just rest now.
                   Rest.

      The doctor slowly exits.     Wade lies there.    Actually relaxes.

                             DEADPOOL (V.O.)
                   Then, just when I thought I could breathe
                   easy...

      Who appears over the PUNCH-BOWL but...

      ...AJAX.

                king.

                You f-fucking sadistic-

                          AJAX
                No. Not fair. Everything I've done to
                you has been in your best interest. Even
                this next bit. You may be cured, but you
                still need to learn to be a better man.
                Polite. Respectful. What better way to
                teach you than to close this lid... and
                keep torturing you stupid.

      Ajax SLAMS the lid shut, LATCHES and LOCKS it. The hissing
      resumes. Wade's eyes grow wide. He starts to slip-slide
      toward absolute ANGUISH.

                          DEADPOOL (V.O.)
                If you think I'm losing my marbles `cause
                I can't breathe. You're only half right.

      Ajax appears to be looking in at Wade. But we RACK FOCUS to
      reveal he's looking at his REFLECTION in the Plexiglas lid,
      checking for stuff between his teeth.

                          DEADPOOL (V.O.)
                See, if Francis was able to see his
                reflection...

      The camera SWINGS around to Wade's POINT-OF-VIEW of Ajax
      through the glass lid, which has been newly ILLUMINATED by
      the surgical light above...

      ...and then RACKS FOCUS to WADE's REFLECTED FACE. Covered
      with HORRIFIC SCARS. Wade is no longer a handsome young man.
      He is a monster. Which is perfectly visible to him one foot
      away.

                          DEADPOOL (V.O.)
                You know what they say. You always
                remember your first time.

      Wade throws back his head in a SILENT SCREAM.

                          DEADPOOL (V.O.)
                Even  years later...
                                                                       .
                    



     EXT./INT.   SCRAP-YARD / GROUND - DAY - PRESENT                       

       Back in the PRESENT, we find ourselves in a huge SCRAP-YARD,
       where various ships, planes, etc. are sold for scrap iron.

       Among various vehicles is an OLD, BATTERED COMBAT CARRIER,
       long given up for dead.

       A heavy truck navigates through the heaps of scrap-metal and
       grinds to a stop in front of the carrier.

       Two heavyset MEN climb down and head toward the back of the
       truck, heave the heavy door open.

       AJAX and ANGEL DUST stand just inside, boxes and gear piled
       up behind them. They hop down as four more rough-looking men
       pile out behind them.

       Angel Dust drags out a WOODEN CRATE. The planks crunch as
       she digs her fingers into the wood and heaves it up on one
       burly shoulder as if it weighed no more than a sack of flour.
       Heavy AMMO peeks through.

                             ANGEL DUST
                   Better to be the hunter than the hunted.

       Ajax and Angel Dust walk across the muddy yard toward a
       service elevator bolted to the rusting hulk of the carrier.

                             AJAX
                   Either I kill him, or he kills me.     Let's
                   put him out of our misery...

VA   INT.   GARBAGE TRUCK - DAY                                        VA

       DEADPOOL lays horizontal.     He is speaking to the AUDIENCE:

                             DEADPOOL
                   There... all caught up.

       He CLIMBS up and out of the GARBAGE TRUCK.

                             DEADPOOL (CONT'D)
                       (yells to driver)
                   Thanks for the lift! Apologies if I bled
                   in the recyclables.

     INT./EXT.   DEADPOOL'S LAIR - DAY - PRESENT                           

       A mid-city DUPLEX. Borderline ghetto. Semi-furnished,
       `first apartment' quality: futons and torchiere lamps.




                                                                  
                                                                      .
                   
                                                                

     Stained carpet, currently being swept by a roaming ROOMBA.
     IKEA... everywhere.

     The same old AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMAN we glimpsed early in the
     movie - late 's - purple floral dress - sits on a ratty
     couch, where the typical old woman might KNIT.

     Instead, this old woman uses a BOX-CUTTER to lay waste to a
     BIG CARDBOARD BOX from IKEA - the `IVAR SHELVING UNIT.'

     She lays out its components and tools on a wobbly IKEA NORNAS
     COFFEE TABLE...

     ...made more difficult by the fact that she is completely
     BLIND. This is Deadpool's roommate, BLIND AL.

     Suddenly, Blind Al's KEEN EAR picks up a faint, distant
     KNOCKING. She cocks her head to LISTEN.

   EXT. DEADPOOL'S LAIR - DAY - PRESENT                                   

     ANGLE ON THE FRONT YARD:

     Dirt. No grass. ` Chevy Avon up on BLOCKS. An exhausted
     DEADPOOL is slumped against his own front door, red suit, no
     mask, no right HAND. He is KNOCKING weakly on the door with
     the SIDE of his HEAD.

   INT. DEADPOOL'S LAIR - DAY - PRESENT                                   

     ANGLE ON THE LIVING ROOM:

     BLIND AL stands up in comfy creme nursing shoes. Grabs her
     red-tipped CANE. And shuffles toward the front door...

     ...when she is TRIPPED by the ROOMBA.        She FACE-PLANTS.

                            DEADPOOL (O.S.)
                      (from outside)
                  Let's get ready to Rooooooomba!

                            BLIND AL
                      (under breath)
                  Ass-hat.

     Al SWINGS her cane angrily, again and again, trying to hit
     the robotic vacuum, which moves happily just out of reach.

     She reaches her knees and stretches for the door when...

     ...DEADPOOL SPRINGS it open from outside, SLAMMING it into
     her HEAD. Blind Al goes down again.



                                                                 
                                                                       .
                   
                                                                 

                            DEADPOOL
                  Morning, roomie!
                      (sniffs)
                  This place reeks like old lady pants.

                            BLIND AL
                      (still supine)
                  Yes. I'm old. I wear pants.

                            DEADPOOL
                  But you're no lady.

     Blind Al struggles to a sitting position. Deadpool walks
     past her in his socks, drops his muddy BOOTS to the floor and
     slips into a pair of POWDER-BLUE CROCS parked just inside the
     door.

                              DEADPOOL (CONT'D)
                  So comfy.

                            BLIND AL
                  Upside of being blind:     I've never seen
                  you in Crocs.

                            DEADPOOL
                  You mean my big rubber masturbatin'
                  shoes?

                            BLIND AL
                  Yes I know. Downside of being blind:        I
                  hear everything in this duplex.

     Deadpool walks bitterly past one wall of the DUPLEX, which is
     COVERED - WALL-to-WALL, FLOOR-to-CEILING, with CHRISTMAS
     ADVENT CALENDARS.

     Tons of ornaments/candies/etc. adorn the calendars.            There's
     not ONE CALENDAR left uncovered.

                            DEADPOOL
                  One-thousand eight-hundred twenty-two
                  ornaments pinned to two-hundred-sixty
                  calendars. All for a `Christmas' that...
                  never... came!

                            BLIND AL
                  Too much naughty, too little nice.

                            DEADPOOL
                  Sit on a stick.

     DEADPOOL SPLAYS OUT on a white futon, MOANING, nursing his
     horrifying wound.


                                                                  
                                                                      .
                Deadpool      Final Shooting Script   
                                                            

                             BLIND AL
               Bactine?

                         DEADPOOL
                   (dripping sarcasm)
               Yeah. Bactine should do it. How's the
               Kullen coming? IKEA doesn't assemble
               itself.

     Blind Al sits back on the ratty couch and begins applying the
     finishing touches to the shelving unit.

                         BLIND AL
               You're telling me. I don't mind the
               Kullen. It's an improvement on the
               Hurdal.

                         DEADPOOL
               Anything's an improvement on the Hurdal.
               I'd have taken a Hemnes... or even a
               Trysil... over the Hurdal. But I didn't
               get excited `til I saw the Kullen.

                         BLIND AL
               Screw please.

                         DEADPOOL
               Here? Now? Just kidding.          I know it's
               been decades for you.

                         BLIND AL
               You'd be surprised.

                         DEADPOOL
               And totally grossed out!

     Blind Al turns the final screw, beyond unenthusiastic.

                             BLIND AL
               Ta.    Dah.

     The dresser look like the Leaning Tower of Piza in shitty
     particle board. Deadpool TOSSES a DIRTY MAGAZINE on top.
     The Kullen COLLAPSES.

                         BLIND AL (CONT'D)
               I wish I'd never heard of Craig's List.

                         DEADPOOL
               And I quote: `Looking for roommate.
               Blind to life's imperfections. Must be
               good with hands.' Or wouldya rather I
               build IKEA and you pay rent?


                                                                 
                                                                       .
                  
                                                             

                           BLIND AL
                 Why such a douche this morning?

                           DEADPOOL
                 Let's recap. That cock-thistle who
                 turned me into this freak... the one I've
                 been waiting five years for... slipped
                 through my arms today. Arm.

       Deadpool holds up his previously severed arm, which now has
       a little tweenage ARM emerging off it. Yes. Deadpool can
       GROW BACK LIMBS.

                           DEADPOOL (CONT'D)
                 Catching him was my only chance to be hot
                 again. Get my super-sexy ex back. And
                 stop the same shit from happening to
                 anyone else. So yeah, things are pretty
                 fucking scrumptious.

       Deadpool stands. Walks behind the couch, and as he passes
       the back of Blind Al's head... FARTS.

                           DEADPOOL (CONT'D)
                 Hash-tag Drive-by.

                           BLIND AL
                     (to herself)
                 I'm gonna find this `Craig.'        And I'm
                 gonna kill him.

                           DEADPOOL
                 Once I've got the cure, I'm gonna do the
                 same to Francis...

RS   INT. WORKSHOP TENT - LATER                                        RS

       WADE, newly scarred, hidden in darkness, continues to GASP as
       though being held underwater. Then the lid on the punch-bowl
       SLIDES BACK, revealing AJAX. Wade takes deep LUNGS-FUL of
       AIR. Ajax leans in for a closer look.

                           AJAX
                 Bloody hell. Someone lost his shot at
                 homecoming king.

                           WADE
                     (can barely speak)
                 What have you done to me?!

                           AJAX
                 You give me too much credit. This...
                 this is the result of your genes.

                    The punch bowl merely raised your stress
                    to trigger the mutation.

                              WADE
                    You... sadistic... fuck!

                              AJAX
                    Where's the gratitude?! You're cured!
                    Your mutated cells can heal anything.
                    They're attacking the cancer as fast as
                    it can form. Your insides are a war
                    zone. Not to mention your outsides!

       Wade looks stunned as he struggles to process all this
       information. Ajax smiles down.

                              AJAX (CONT'D)
                    I've seen similar side-effects before.         I
                    could cure them for you. But really,
                    where's the fun in that?

       Wade says nothing, hating him but wanting to believe.

                              AJAX (CONT'D)
                    I'm going to close this lid again.     Maybe
                    you no longer need it. But I do.

       For a long moment, Wade stares intensely at Ajax and sees...
       nothing, a black hole of empathy. And he knows this is a man
       who will never stop hurting him.

       ***NOTE: We will not be reshooting the rest of the scene
       below with the exception of the final shot.****

       So he turns his gaze to the ceiling and WITHDRAWS into
       himself... the one place the cruelty can no longer reach him.

       Angel Dust enters, chewing on her usual matchstick.

                              AJAX
                    He's all yours.

       Angel leans over the Punch-bowl, starts to undo Wade's
       restraints.

                              ANGEL
                    You smell like shit.

       When Angel Dust leans close to Wade's head he suddenly comes
       alive and uses the strength he has left to HEAD-BUTT her in
       the FOREHEAD.

                  Hey, hey, alright. It's alright. I
                  think he earned that one, yeah? You take
                  off. Go on... off you go.

     As Angel Dust EXITS the tent, she reaches to her mouth for
     her matchstick... only it's not there. She frowns, fishes
     another match from her pocket, and tucks it between her lips.

     Ajax finishes strapping Wade back down and goes to close the
     lid.

                            AJAX (CONT'D)
                  One question. What's my name?

     Wade remains listless, mouth SHUT.       BLINKS.

                            AJAX (CONT'D)
                  Didn't think so.

     Ajax CLOSES and LOCKS the lid.      HISS.    The oxygen DIALS FALL.

                            DEADPOOL (V.O.)
                  Sorry, Francis. But my lips are sealed.

     And then we're inside the punch bowl with Wade as the oxygen
     levels drop and the suffering rises. Through a fog of misery
     Wade sees Ajax staring down, watching him, drinking in his
     pain.

   INT.   WORKSHOP - NIGHT - PAST                                           

     Back in the Punch-Bowl, Wade OPENS his MOUTH... within which
     he was HIDING a SINGLE MATCHSTICK, clenched carefully - dryly
     - between his teeth.

     He inhales... then SPITS OUT the match into his waiting PALM.
     Finally, he STRIKES it against the side of the Punch Bowl.

     Wade aims the now FLAMING match toward the tiny HOLE through
     which OXYGEN flows. The match is quickly burning down. Will
     it reach the hole before it snuffs out?

     At the last possible moment...

     ...the flame COMBUSTS the stream of oxygen, IGNITING it...



                                                                   
                                                                        .
                  Deadpool     Final Shooting Script    
                                                                  

     ...back through the TRANSPARENT PLASTIC TUBE that trails
     outside the Punch-Bowl.

     The flame SNAKES through the tube, this way and that, until
     it reaches the OXYGEN TANK standing next to the Punch-Bowl.
     A beat. Then the TANK EXPLODES.

     The   BLOWS APART.      The hospital bed SNAPS in TWO.

     Out in the ward, the FIREBALL curls outward, spreading from
     TENT to TENT. BOOM! BOOM! Other flammable tanks DETONATE.

     The tents GO UP like ROMAN CANDLES.        It's now MASS CHAOS.

     ALARMS BLARE.    Flames LEAP.     Smoke BILLOWS.     Patients FLEE.

     A CURTAIN of FIRE suddenly DISPERSES, replaced by billowy
     WHITE SMOKE from an OVER-SIZED CHROME FIRE EXTINGUISHER...

     ...held by AJAX, who STRIDES grimly toward Wade's tent.             He
     throws back the burning fabric...

     ...and nearly EATS an OXYGEN TANK.        He BLOCKS it at the last
     moment with his FIRE EXTINGUISHER.        CLANG.

     On the other end of the oxygen tank, WIND-MILLING it with
     unbridled FEROCITY, is WADE.

     WADE and AJAX SWING the oxygen tank and fire extinguisher
     like modern day CLUBS, trying to take off each other's heads.

     CLANG!   BANG!   BAM!    The tanks COLLIDE in mid-air.

     Ajax's fingers CRUNCH between metal.        He doesn't even feel
     it.

     Wade grabs the HOSE of Ajax's fire extinguisher, angles it
     up, and gets his finger on the TRIGGER.

     The extinguisher BLASTS.      Ajax is momentarily BLINDED.

     Wade brings the oxygen tank down like a LUMBERJACK'S AXE.
     Ajax BLOCKS it, but is driven to his KNEES.

     Wade's eyes are lit with fire. DOWN the tank COMES, again
     and AGAIN. Ajax takes his own fire extinguisher to the CHIN.
     Then catches a BLOW from the oxygen TANK to his TEMPLE.

     The extinguisher goes FLYING. Wade swings the OXYGEN TANK
     AGAIN, but against all odds, AJAX CATCHES it and SLAMS it
     back into Wade's NOSE. CRUNCH.




                                                                   
                                                                     .
                
                                                           

     Ajax rises to his feet, and the two grip OPPOSITE SIDES of
     the OXYGEN TANK, GRAPPLING with every ounce of strength.

     Wade sweeps Ajax's feet and he topples over backwards, Wade
     on top of him. Wade lifts the heavy tank and slams it into
     his face. Once. Twice. Three times. CRACK.

     As he's about to finish the job Ajax smiles, blood bubbling
     from his smashed lips.

                         AJAX
               You can't kill me, Wade. I'm the only
               one who can fix that ugly mug.

     Wade looks torn as his rage gives way to something like hope.
     He tosses the tank away.

                         WADE
               Then time to make me me again.

     A scream of terror behind Wade makes Wade turn.

                          CUNNINGHAM (O.S.)
               Wade!   Help! Wade!

     Wade looks through the smoke and flame and spies a helpless
     Cunningham lying in the flaming wreckage.

                            WADE
               Fuck!

     Wade drops Ajax and SPRINTS to Cunningham, starts dragging at
     the WRECKAGE trapping him, when... SLICE! A long piece of
     sheared REBAR THRUSTS CLEAN THROUGH his CHEST from BEHIND.
     The force sends the spear DEEP into the wooden floor beams,
     pinning Wade like an insect in an entomologist's display.

     In a grand display of strength, AJAX BENDS the end of the
     rebar to keep Wade pinned... then walks around and squats
     down into Wade's eye line, wearing a triumphant sneer.

                            AJAX
               Say it.     `Francis.'

     Blood dribbles from Wade's mouth as he tries in vain to push
     himself off the bloody spike of metal. Ajax rises, scans the
     burning workshop with a scowl - clearly a lost cause - and
     turns to leave.

     Cunningham screams again as the flames near him. Grunting
     with the pain and effort Wade tries to push himself off the
     spike.

      His hands slip on the blood-slick metal, and he cannot free
      himself. His VOLTRON RING lies on the floor next to him.

      Wade and Cunningham share a last look.          Cunningham clamps his
      jaws shut, fighting the agony.

      CREAK... CRACKLE... the ROOF COLLAPSES, BURYING BOTH OF THEM.
      And we... CUT TO BLACK.

      Morning's first sunlight. WADE's VOLTRON RING lies
      COMPLETELY MELTED in the DEBRIS. The camera follows it to
      Wade's hand... then up his arm to his FACE.

      WADE's eyelids flutter, and he COMES TO. He is naked, his
      hospital gown burned away. We see BLACKENED SLUDGE, SOOT,
      charred remains. The melted and scorched metal rod next to
      him.

      Wade slowly realizes where he is and what happened. He
      reaches down to his stomach wound... WHICH HAS MIRACULOUSLY
      HEALED. Wade sits up, stunned.

                            DEADPOOL (V.O.)

                  I got the cure to everything.

V   EXT. CITY STREET - MORNING - PAST                                        V

      VANESSA, tired, broken, mind seemingly elsewhere, walks
      towards her apartment. She passes a loving young COUPLE, arm-
      in-arm.

      Vanessa clocks this sadly, continues on.

      Behind her, PEOPLE walk to and fro.      Among them, we REVEAL:

      WADE, dressed in ill-fitting pants and a hoodie. He is a
      TRAIN-WRECK, scarred face on display to the world for the
      first time.

      He looks purposeful, but tentative, walking behind Vanessa,
      GAINING on her.

      ANGLE ON:   WADE's P.O.V.

      A BOY goes by on his bike, trying hard not to gape. A
      TODDLER in a STROLLER looks up and BURSTS INTO TEARS. The
      toddler's MOTHER hustles past.

                             MOTHER
                   Alex, don't stare.

      VANESSA stops and rifles through her purse for keys.

      STILL on Wade's P.O.V. Wade stops, too, suddenly paralyzed,
      as the moment to face Vanessa arrives.

      As he hesitates, torn with anguish, the WHISPERS seem to
      grow, rising in volume until they become deafening:

                             WHISPER  (O.S.)
                   Oh, my, god, that is so fucking gnarly.

                             WHISPER  (O.S.)
                   I just lost my appetite.

      Wade spins, trying to see where the voices are coming from.
      Nowhere... everywhere. The WHISPERS crescendo, now more in
      Wade's mind than in reality.

      He turns back to Vanessa, his face a mask of fear and pain...
      just as she disappears into her apartment building. The
      closing glass door reveals his own HIDEOUS REFLECTION STARING
      BACK AT HIM.

                              DEADPOOL
                   In the whole wide world, there's nothing
                   as ugly...
                       (beat)
                   ...as fear.

      He gives up on his mission, backing away from his reflection,
      Vanessa, his old life. He stumbles off the curb and into the
      street, when... BAM!

      He is CRUSHED OUT OF FRAME by a SPEEDING BUS.

      Without warning, the MIDDLE bag SITS UP STRAIGHT at the
      WAIST...

      slab...

B    INT.   DEADPOOL'S LAIR - NIGHT                                           B

       An FBI-STYLE `ORGANIZATIONAL CHART' has been pinned on Wade's
       CORKBOARD in the lair. A `pyramid' of baddies are linked by
       strings. Each baddie is depicted not by a photograph, but a
       child-like CRAYON DRAWING.

       Second from the top is the RECRUITER.

       At the APEX of the pyramid is AJAX HIMSELF.

       DEADPOOL, in his LAIR, sews together an early `proto-
       costume.'

       We see quick cuts of pieces of it going on:

       White Adidas track suit. White gloves.            White boots.     And
       some sort of white mask...

       A single gun, underarm holster, boot knife but no swords.

   INT.   POOL HALL - NIGHT

                    Don't make me ask twice.     Where's
                    Francis?!

       DEADPOOL questions a bleeding thug, more bodies scattered
       across a floor littered with broken furniture behind him.

       Another thug rushes in and smashes a pool cue over Deadpool's
       skull. Deadpool snatches the broken shaft of wood and PUNCHES
       it into the thugs belly.

       A third thug staggers to his feet, pulls a pistol, fires
       multiple shots point blank. Deadpool staggers back, blood
       blossoming across his white suit.

       "CLICK"

       The thug stares in disbelief that Deadpool's still standing.

       Deadpool looks down at the shaft of wood in his hand.
       Thinks.

                    You made me ask twice.

       Deadpool spins the bloody cue with inhuman dexterity and
       starts towards the terrified thug, accidentally knocking over
       a PITCHER of BLOODY MARY onto his already bloody stained
       suit.

                                  DEADPOOL (CONT'D)

       DEADPOOL, TIDE STAIN-STICK in hand, tries unsuccessfully to
       get the blood out of his white suit.

       We get our first glimpse of BLIND AL, who's sitting next to
       Deadpool at the laundromat, completely unfazed by the
       bloodbath:

                              BLIND AL
                    Seltzer water and lemon for blood.

                         look, shrugs)
                    Or wear red.

       Deadpool's eyes light up. He crumples this suit into a ball
       and tosses it into a trash bin.

       DEADPOOL's at the sewing machine again.

       Deadpool stands in the shadows of a dingy basement, low
       ceilings, walls stacked high with cases of liquor.

       In a BOXING RING at the center of the room two WOMEN pound
       each other surrounded by a scrum of a CROWD. Deadpool spies
       his mark in a dirty white suit pressed in tight ringside.

       Deadpool pulls his mask down, wades into the crowd, throwing
       men aside, PLOWING toward his target.

       The mark sees Deadpool at the last second, turns as a KATANA
       flashes out and skewers his hand, pinning it to the wall.
       Deadpool fires a couple shots into the ceiling, sending the
       rest of the crowd rushing for the exit.

                    Donde esta Francisco?

                    Take me to your leader.

                    I've always wanted to say that.

                    Squeal.     Like a pig. Where's Francis?



                              DEADPOOL
                    In no particular order. Where's your

                   know about Francis Freeman. Known

       BOOM!    STAB!

       DEADPOOL questions more and more thugs, each bit of
       information bringing him closer....

       Soon there is a FOREST of knives sticking from the board.

       ...and only the RECRUITER and AJAX are left.

K/VK INT.   RICE WORLD - NIGHT                                    K/VK

       A wretched room, dirty mattresses covering the floor. Dim
       light scatters through a tangle of IV bags hastily strung up
       over MEN too poor to have anywhere else to go and die.

       The RECRUITER kneels, speaking quietly to a particularly
       hardened patient. He places a card in the man's emaciated
       hand, then stands and walks toward a low doorway.

       The recruiter enters a brightly lit room stacked high with
       bags of rice. Two heavily armed THUGS fall in beside him.
       The men scan the aisles as they move toward a door leading
       out into an alley.

                              DEADPOOL
                    Agent Smith!

       They turn to see DEADPOOL, high atop a stack of rice bags.

                              DEADPOOL (CONT'D)
                    I know, right?! I look like a million

                    Literally - this suit cost Fox a million
                    dollars.

       Without a word, the Recruiter flees, running through the big
       roll-up door.

       Deadpool leaps to land between the two bodyguards as they
       draw their weapons and spray the room with gunfire.

       One goes down in a bloody heap. Deadpool leaps toward the
       other, skewers him with both swords. The thug falls
       backward, dead before he hits the ground.

       The Recruiter has stepped timidly from between overflowing
       garbage bins, hands raised, eager to talk his way out of this
       mess:

                              RECRUITER
                    To whom should I address my... desperate

                    I'm gonna make you feel worse. Wait...

       Deadpool brings the sword closer to the recruiter's face.
       Turns to CAMERA:

                              DEADPOOL (CONT'D)

                    Wrong. I'm a monster, inside and out. I
                    belong in a circus, the kind that rolls

                    sex with an older avocado.

       Wade grabs the bottle of JACK DANIELS from the table,
       GUZZLES.

                    text and phone only.

                    And the only guy who can fix this fugly

       dresses - piece-by-piece - in the RED UNIFORM we've come to
       know and love. And at last, UNSHEATHES A KATANA. The sword
       TWIRLS, SLASHES, LUNGES into shadow. A HANDKERCHIEF WIPES
       BLOOD from the BLADE. The katana gets SHEATHED again.

       The same yellow card is now RECEIVED and PUNCHED by Weasel.
       Wade is paid in TWENTY DOLLAR BILLS. WHIP CREAM froths onto
       a shot glass. A BLOW-JOB is TOSSED BACK.

       Meanwhile, VANESSA plays SKEE-BALL wistfully by herself at
       the ARCADE:

       SKEE-BALLS roll into HOLES. LIGHTS FLASH. TICKETS CHURN
       OUT. VANESSA catches a reflection of someone STARING at her
       from across the lobby. When she spins around, the culprit is
       GONE. Vanessa SHIVERS... but it's a warm shiver, somehow.

       A HEAP of TICKETS slides across the prize counter. A big
       STUFFED ANIMAL slides into Vanessa's arms. Vanessa tosses it
       into an empty CLOSET inside her and Wade's former APARTMENT.
       Then stares out the SPIDER-WEB CRACK in the window.

       Back at DEADPOOL's LAIR, Deadpool places various suspicious
       accoutrements on the NORNAS COFFEE TABLE: an x framed
       photo of VANESSA. A BOTTLE of JERGENS. A BOX of KLEENEX.
       His BELT. His powder-blue CROCS. Deadpool kicks back on the
       FUTON. Smiles under his mask.

       CUT TO: BLIND AL, building yet another shelving unit,
       looking up with a grossed-out frown: `Am I hearing what I
       think I'm hearing?'

       Next, DEADPOOL finishes plastering hundreds of ADVENT
       CALENDARS he's purchased onto one WALL of his LAIR.



                                                                   
                                                                      .
                   
A                                                            A

      When the wall is covered, he carefully pins the FIRST
      ornament onto the FIRST tree on the FIRST calendar.

      And at last, his MASK comes OFF and his HEAD hits the PILLOW.

      Instantly, the montage CRANKS UP its SPEED, with quicker and
      quicker EDITS.

      The visual totems that have just been introduced begin to FLY
      by... shorthand for the passage of time:

      Yellow cards are given, received, punched.

      Blades are unsheathed, sheathed, cleaned.

      Whip cream sprayed.     Drinks consumed.

      Skee-balls rolled into holes. Tickets won. Prizes earned.
      Tossed onto a EVER-GROWING PILE in the closet. VANESSA
      staring out her window.

      Jergens pumped. Kleenexes pulled.       Crocs discarded.      BLIND
      AL's ears plugged.

      Ornaments are pinned to calendars.      Lords a-leap.      Swans a-
      swim. Maids a-milk.

      Mask comes off.    Head hits pillow.    Mask pulls on.

      The images fly by FASTER... FASTER... FASTER.

      Whip cream. Skee-balls.     Crocs.    Ornaments.   Weasel.
      Deadpool. Vanessa. Al.

      `I NEED A HERO' plays faster and faster, too - higher and
      higher, like a record on too many RPMs.

      The effect is rhythmic... hypnotic...

      ...until finally, the montage REACHES a CRESCENDO.

      And then BOOM!    Ratchets back to REGULAR SPEED:

      `CHRISTMAS MORNING' has arrived. All the calendars but one
      are now fully studded with decorations. DEADPOOL plucks out
      one last STAR to pin atop the final TREE.

      Only it's not a star at all, it's AJAX's MUG SHOT clipped out
      from the old NEWSPAPER.

      With great satisfaction, Deadpool pins the faded photo to the
      last treetop. The music dies, and Deadpool turns to camera.

      He HOPS ACROSS the hall past BLIND AL, not really paying
      attention to her. We're revisiting the moment from earlier
      JUST AFTER she TRIPS on Deadpool's DUFFEL of AMMUNITION,
      PICKS it up, and DRAGS it OFF.

                           DEADPOOL (CONT'D)

    EXT.   CITY STREET - DAY - PAST                                     

      DEADPOOL runs out to the street corner and WAVES.

                             DEADPOOL
                 Taxi!

      A TAXI - if you've been paying attention, you will recognize
      it - pulls up to the curb. Deadpool opens the rear door. A
      WOMAN steps out, pausing to pay Dopinder.

                           WOMAN
                 Keep the change.

      Deadpool frowns. The woman is pulling her money from a
      BERNADETTE PETERS CHANGE PURSE. Deadpool's eyes raise from
      the purse to the woman holding it: BERNADETTE PETERS
      HERSELF! Deadpool doubletakes, then shakes his head (`Nah,
      couldn't be...') and climbs into the cab. Who is behind the
      wheel but...

                           DOPINDER
                 Where do you want to be going!

                     And we all know how this turned out.
                     Cue Benny Hill speed...

        The action goes into Benny-Hill-like HYPER-SPEED as we relive
        the opening scenes of the movie: DEADPOOL's CAB RIDE. AJAX
        crumpling up his orange jumpsuit and switching places with a
        motorcycle RIDER at the RAFT. The FREEWAY FIGHT with AJAX's
        GOONS. The CONFRONTATION with COLOSSUS. Until at last...

VRS   EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY                                              VRS

        Transport TRUCKS idle in the loading dock.

        A docile SUPER-SLAVE, fitted with a control collar and cuffs,
        steps into a CRATE IDENTICAL to the ONES AJAX DELIVERED TO
        THE WARLORD in ACT ONE. He lies down.

        ANGEL DUST is overseeing.      She plunges a pistol-grip syringe
        into his neck and fires:

                               ANGEL DUST
                     For your flight.

        The man's eyelids flutter shut. Next to him, four identical
        crates hold four unconscious men and women. The workshop
        henchmen hammer on the tops and laboriously load them up into
        the truck.

        ANGEL picks up one over her shoulder with ease. She turns at
        the sound of a sputtering motorcycle getting closer.

        Ajax rolls in on one of the battered black bikes from the
        freeway. Smoke curls from its broken tailpipe.

        He steps off the bike while it's still moving, just letting
        it roll forward and tip to the ground with a clank.

                               AJAX (O.S.)
                     Quit showing off, Angel.

        Angel doesn't seem surprised by his dirty and bloodied
        appearance. A raised eyebrow and a disapproving look is all
        she has for her boss.

        ANGEL DUST stands in front of him, putting stitches into his
        GORY MESS of a SHOULDER WOUND.

        He doesn't so much as FLINCH.

                               ANGEL DUST
                     Makes perfect sense.

                               AJAX
                     I suppose if I looked like him, I'd wear
                     a mask too.
                         (Angel finishes final
                          stitch)
                     Only wish I mended the same.

        Ajax pops off the table.     Swings his arm around, testing his
        shoulder.

                     Not to worry. We'll put him out of our
                     misery. On our terms.

                     as usual.

        Ajax's hand is a blur as he plucks the MATCHSTICK from
        Angel's mouth.

        BLIND AL shuffles over from the kitchen with a cup of tea and

        Deadpool.

                                                                    .

                          WEASEL
                Or as I like to call her, Irony!

     DEADPOOL navigates through a TIGHTLY-PACKED CROWD toward the
     MAIN STAGE, accompanied by WEASEL.

                          DEADPOOL
                We gotta find her fast.    Before fuck-ass.

                          WEASEL
                How do you even know she's here?

                          DEADPOOL
                I come for the French Onion Soup. How do
                you think? I'm constantly stalking that
                fox.

     Deadpool STOPS in his tracks, STARING.

                          DEADPOOL (V.O.)
                Every time I see her is like the first
                time.

     REVERSE ANGLE to reveal what Deadpool is looking at: the
     gorgeous backside of a COCKTAIL WAITRESS in a skimpy dress.
     Back to Deadpool:

                          DEADPOOL (V.O.)
                Even from this angle. Especially from
                this angle.

     Hypnotized, Deadpool puts one foot in front of the other,
     approaching the waitress.

     Suddenly, the WAITRESS TURNS to reveal her face:       VANESSA.

     Deadpool immediately CHICKENS OUT, puts his head down, turns
     away from her into the press of MEN around one of the stages.

     Vanessa catches the vaguest glimpse, but before she can get a
     better look, Deadpool is swallowed up by the crowd.

     She gets that warm shiver again... the one that says she's
     feeling an old presence.

     She stares after Deadpool.    It couldn't possibly be.

     Deadpool pushes past the men, almost in a panic, beating a
     HASTY RETREAT toward WEASEL at the back of the room.

                            DEADPOOL (V.O.)
                  Shittiest moment numero tres.

     Deadpool walks past Weasel, fleeing into the men's room...

   INT.   MEN'S REST ROOM - CONTINUOUS                                    

     ...and SPLASH!     Washes his face at the SINK.

                            DEADPOOL
                  Lezzdothis. Before I re-reconsider.
                  Maximum effort.

     A hand comes into frame offering a paper towel. It belongs
     to a WASHROOM ATTENDANT in a tuxedo vest. Deadpool uses the
     towel to wipe his face and finishes with the attendant's
     sleeve.

                            DEADPOOL (CONT'D)
                  Sorry.
                      (tries to dry attendant's
                       sleeve with paper towel)
                  I get very uncomfortable around you guys.
                      (takes mint off counter,
                       then condom off counter,
                       then sees tip jar)
                  Crisp high five?

   INT.   `NO.  ORANGE' STRIP CLUB - NIGHT                               

     VANESSA sets down a tray of empty glasses.        Her scum-bag of a
     MANAGER gives her a heads-up:

                            MANAGER
                  Someone out back asking for you. Said
                  somethin' about an old boyfriend?

   EXT.   `NO.  ORANGE' STRIP CLUB - ALLEY - NIGHT                       

     VANESSA exits the club into an ALLEY, one of Wade's old
     jackets thrown over her shoulders. One sickly street lamp
     casts some light. The rest is obscured in SHADOW. Vanessa
     spies the shape of a MAN hiding in the shadows.

                            VANESSA
                  I knew it was you.

     Vanessa is seized by memories.      She peers into the dark,
     heart pounding.

                            VANESSA (CONT'D)
                  With the weird, curvy edges.



                                                                 
                                                                      .
                   
                                                                

     Then steps forward slowly, nervously.        Overcome with emotion.

                            VANESSA (CONT'D)
                      (barely audible)
                  Like a jigsaw puzzle.

     No one answers.     Vanessa gets a bad feeling and starts to
     back up.

     The man steps confidently into the light.        Not WADE...

     ...but AJAX. Vanessa spins around and runs straight into
     Angel Dust, who step out of the shadows.

     Vanessa make a grab for her purse, contents spilling out onto
     the grimy street, but her hand comes up with a TASER. She
     jams it into the flesh of Angel Dusts shoulder.

     Angel Dust just smiles as electricity arcs and sizzles.           Then
     she grabs Vanessa's hand and twists it away.

     Vanessa THRASHES like a polecat. But Angel Dust is brutally
     strong. She clamps her hand around Vanessa's jaw and
     SQUEEZES, dangling her in the air by her FACE.

                            AJAX
                  You have Wade Wilson to thank for this.

     Vanessa's eyes widen in shock and surprise.

                            AJAX (CONT'D)
                  `The good Lord sends the fishing...

     Vanessa screams mutely into Angel Dust's palm.

                            AJAX (CONT'D)
                  ...but you must dig the bait.'

   INT.   `NO.  ORANGE' STRIP CLUB - HALLWAY - NIGHT                     

     WADE pushes through the crowd to find WEASEL sitting in GYNO
     ROW at the edge of the stage. He's in the middle of slipping
     a bill into a dancer's garter.

                            WEASEL
                  Manager said she went that way.
                      (thumbs towards the back)
                  Good luck, Tiger!

     DEADPOOL moves quickly down a HALL, turns a corner, and
     REACHES for the knob of the door to the alley. His eyes
     WIDEN as he remembers something IMPORTANT.

       Deadpool reaches back and pulls up his hood to hide his
       scarred FACE.

       Deadpool girds himself, then OPENS the door to spy...

     EXT. `NO.  ORANGE' STRIP CLUB - ALLEY - NIGHT                         

       ...the empty alley. Deadpool spies a woman's CLUTCH lying
       alone in a pool of light, contents strewn about. He reaches
       down and picks up...

       ...his old BERNADETTE PETERS CHANGE PURSE.

                              DEADPOOL
                    Mother-fucker best be wearing his brown
                    pants.

     INT.   SCRAPYARD / ELEVATOR - PRE-DAWN                                 

       AJAX and Angel Dust stand at either side of a bound and
       gagged VANESSA. They are inside the metal cage of an
       INDUSTRIAL ELEVATOR, going UP.

                              DEADPOOL (V.O.)
                    And... numero dos.

       A bare bulb casts harsh light as they rise past a dark mass
       of twisted metal. Ajax looks almost bored, hums to himself
       tunelessly.

                              AJAX
                    That's what I thought, but he keeps on
                    coming back. Like a Bad Jesus. But
                    despite all Wade's powers, I still hold
                    the advantage: He feels. Too strongly
                    for his own good. Let's see how he
                    fights with your head on the block.

       Who is standing outside the front door of the mansion but
       DEADPOOL, in full regalia. Deadpool raises his knuckles to
       KNOCK, but is suddenly STARTLED...

                              DEADPOOL
                    Like there's something wrong with eating
                    before sundown. Or saving money. But
                    no. It's about me saving my girl from a
                    bad guy, the one you two helped me lose.
                    You do fight bad guys?
                        (off NTW's stare)
                    No time for hard stares, are you gonna
                    fetch big-shiny-balls or not? Tell him I
                    have an offer he can't refuse!

       NTW turns, disappears into the house.

       floor:

                              COLOSSUS (O.S.)
                    Is that you, Wade?! I knew you'd see

                    ways! I just need an itty bitty favor in

     WEASEL and DEADPOOL are going through IKEA drawers, pulling
     out every GUN and GRENADE on God's green earth and stuffing
     them into a couple of Deadpool's `I *HEART* HELLO KITTY'
     DUFFEL BAGS.

     This is Deadpool's ARSENAL, big enough for a small army.           In
     go the twin DESERT EAGLES. Then Weasel dumps an entire
     ARMFUL of AMMO BOXES into the duffel.

                          WEASEL
                That's about... three thousand shells.

     A BEAT.   Deadpool LOOKS AT CAMERA menacingly:

                          DEADPOOL
                And we've all seen what I can do with
                twelve.

     BLIND AL enters, holding a STEYR AUG RIFLE.

                          BLIND AL
                I was gonna spend tonight assembling the
                Borgsjo, but this is holding my interest.

     Both Deadpool and Weasel duck, afraid she might shoot them.

                          DEADPOOL
                Careful, Ronnie Milsap, we're down-range!
                And we decided on the Orrberg, not the
                Borgsjo.

                            BLIND AL
                Shit.

                            WEASEL
                She cool?

                          DEADPOOL
                The coolest. Plus, she could never pick
                you out of a line-up.

     BEEP-BEEP. DEADPOOL looks at his phone.         The screen says,
     "Vanessa's Phone"

                          DEADPOOL (CONT'D)
                It's Francis. He wants me to come to
                him. And he calls me a piece of-
                    (squints, can't read)




                                                                 
                                                                       .
                   
                                                                 

                            WEASEL
                      (points)
                  That's the shit emoji. A turd with a
                  smile, see? How did Google ever approve
                  that?

     Blind Al grabs a Nerf N-Strike Elite Strong-arm Blaster from
     a drawer (it feels like a gun!) and goes to put it in the
     duffel. Deadpool almost stops her, then shrugs - maybe it
     will come in useful...

                            BLIND AL
                  That's every piece in the house.

                              DEADPOOL
                  Uh-uh-uh.

     Blind Al sighs - busted - she puts her leg up on a chair and
     pulls a tiny Saturday Night Special from an ankle holster...
     and is about to hand it over when instead, she turns, and...

     ...BOOM... shoots the ROOMBA, laying waste to it.

                             BLIND AL
                  It was him or me.
                      (beat)
                  I did hit it, right?

                            DEADPOOL
                  Please. It's been years since you've hit
                  anything. See what I did there?

                              BLIND AL
                  Fuck you.

     Deadpool takes the tiny gun and shoves it in the small of his
     back. Then follows Weasel out the door. Then quickly turns
     back.

                            DEADPOOL
                      (to Al)
                  In case I never see you again, I love you
                  very much... and there's a hundred-ten
                  million dollars buried somewhere in the
                  apartment. Good luck. Watch your face.

     Deadpool slams the door behind him.

   INT./EXT.    TAXI - MORNING                                             

     A TAXI drives across the city, its BACK BUMPER scraping the
     ground, throwing off SPARKS.



                                                                  
                                                                       .
                   Deadpool   Final Shooting Script    
                                                                 

     In the PASSENGER seat: DEADPOOL, his DUFFEL at his feet.
     Behind the wheel: DOPINDER.

                            DEADPOOL
                  Any luck winning Gita back?

                            DOPINDER
                  I tried to hold on tight, Mr. Pool. But
                  Bandhu is more craftier - and handsomer -
                  than me.

                            DEADPOOL
                      (shrugs)
                  It's all relative.

     Deadpool quickly LIFTS his MASK, revealing his SCARS to
     Dopinder.

     STARTLED, Dopinder FLINCHES and SIDESWIPES a PARKED CAR.

                            COLOSSUS (O.S.)
                  Stop the car. I must leave a note.

     Cut to the BACK SEAT to find COLOSSUS CRAMMED in, KNEES to
     CHEST. He's drinking a CAPPUCCINO in a Dunkin' Donuts cup.

                            DEADPOOL
                  Oh, please. I'll bet the halls of your
                  high school were very well monitored.

                            DOPINDER
                  I cannot be stopping.

                            NEGASONIC TEENAGE WARHEAD (O.S.)
                  Wait, I'm getting a premonition.

     To Colossus's left is NEGASONIC TEENAGE WARHEAD. She's
     holding two fingers to her temple again, a la Professor X.
     Then nods toward Dopinder.

                            NEGASONIC TEENAGE WARHEAD (CONT'D)
                  He's uninsured.

                            DOPINDER
                  She indeed has ESPN!    I am quite
                  uninsuranced.

                            DEADPOOL
                  You mean ESP. But come on!      I coulda-

                            NEGASONIC TEENAGE WARHEAD
                  -called that yourself?



                                                                  
                                                                       .
                 Deadpool      Final Shooting Script   
                                                             

                              DEADPOOL
                Gaaaahhhh!

     Deadpool literally BOUNCES in frustration.

                          DOPINDER
                Who brought this twinkly man?

                          DEADPOOL
                Twinkly, but deadly. My big Russki
                friend doesn't like the idea of a whole
                new army of mutant mutton-heads. And I
                told him if he did me this solid, I'd
                consider joining his boy band.

                          COLOSSUS
                It's not a boy band.

                          DEADPOOL
                Sure it's not.

     The cab drives over a SMALL DIP and BOTTOMS OUT.         CLANG.
     BANG. A muffled yelp comes from the TRUNK:

                              VOICE (O.S.)
                Ow!   Help.     Me.

     BEAT.   Dopinder reaches to turn up the RADIO.

                           DEADPOOL
                Uh.   Dopinder. What was that?

                              DOPINDER
                Oh, that?      That was Bandhu.

                              COLOSSUS
                Bandwho?

                          DOPINDER
                My romantic rival, Bandhu. He's tied up
                in the trunk. I'm doing as you said,
                D.P. I plan to gut him like a tandoori
                fish. Then dump his lifeless corpse on
                Gita's doorstep like a cat with a dead
                bird. Mom and Dad will be over the moon.

     Deadpool looks back at Colossus and shrugs.

                          DEADPOOL
                Something must've gotten lost in the
                translation.
                    (gives surreptitious thumbs
                     up to Dopinder)
                          (MORE)

                                                                  
                                                                        .

                          DEADPOOL (CONT'D)
                Seriously. This is no way to win Gita's
                heart. Return Bandhu home safe and
                gentle-like. And then woo Gita with your
                boyish charm...

                          DOPINDER
                Fine, fine. Safe and gentle-like.          Here
                we are...

     Dopinder pulls over and hits the meter.          Then sighs.

                           DOPINDER (CONT'D)
                I too am clairvoyance. I presume a crisp
                high five?

                            DEADPOOL
                For you?    Ten.

                          DOPINDER
                Knock em dead, Pool Boy.

     Deadpool and Dopinder SLAP BOTH HANDS.

                          DEADPOOL
                Time to make the chimichangas.

   EXT.   SCRAPYARD - DAY                                                   

     We hear the first bold notes of DMX's `X GON GIVE IT TO YA.'

     DEADPOOL, COLOSSUS, and NEGASONIC TEENAGE WARHEAD walk in SLO-
     MO across the scrapyard toward the COMBAT CARRIER.

                          DEADPOOL (V.O.)
                Not often a dude ruins your face.
                Destroys your living. Grabs your future
                baby mama. Personally sees to  of your
                 shittiest life moments. And plans to
                lather-rinse-repeat on a buncha new
                chumps. Let's just say, it's beginning
                to look a lot like Christmas...

     This is as cool as Deadpool has ever looked. Muscles
     sprouting muscles. Katanas gleaming. Then, at the height of
     his coolness, Deadpool STOPS, sensing something amiss.

     DMX cuts out. REGULAR SPEED RESUMES as Deadpool looks down
     to spy his FLY DOWN. He ZIPS it UP, embarrassed.

                          DEADPOOL
                    (to camera)
                It happens. A'ight, cue up DMX again.

                             DEADPOOL
                      (freezes, it's missing)
                  Gahhhhhhh!
                      (pulls out a phone, dials)

   INT.   TAXI CAB - DAY                                                   

     DOPINDER drives, head bobbing to a Bhangra Beat, HELLO KITTY
     DUFFEL still sitting in the passenger WHEEL WELL.

     On cue, Dopinder's CELL PHONE RINGS. Dopinder reaches for
     it, then fumbles it away. The phone falls to the floorboard.

     Dopinder looks ahead, sees the approaching traffic light is
     green, ducks down to make a grab, but when he returns his
     eyes to the road, the light is now red.

     Dopinder slams on his brakes. SCREECH! He manages to avoid
     the car in front. BAM! The taxi is REAR-ENDED, its TRUNK
     SMASHED like an accordion. We hear a HOLLER from inside.

                              DOPINDER
                  Bandhu?

   EXT.   SCRAPYARD - DAY                                                  

                            DEADPOOL
                      (hears crash)
                  Goddamnit! Never mind. Nothing that
                  can't be fixed by two swords and...
                      (cracks neck)
                  ...maximum effort.
                      (points to imaginary D.J.)
                  Gimme a beat!

     DMX KICKS IN AGAIN.      Deadpool strides forward in SLO-MO.

     As they near the carrier a dozen armed and armored MERCS
     suddenly rise from behind the piles of scrap metal before
     them. Assault weapons raised, ready to fire.

     The trio stops, Colossus stepping in front of NTW, sheltering
     her behind his armored body.

                            ANGEL DUST (O.S.)
                  No one fires!

     Our heroes crane their necks to spy ANGEL DUST standing on
     the edge of the deck above.



                                                                  
                                                                      .
                   
                                                                

                            ANGEL DUST (CONT'D)
                  They're mine.

     Angel Dust LEAPS outward, falls like a stone, HITS the ground
     with a THUNDEROUS impact. The dust clears. She strides over
     the broken ground, smiling, READY for a scrap.

                             DEADPOOL
                  Long term, that's hard on your knees.
                      (ALT:)
                  Super-hero landing! Clearly you're far
                  too much dude for me. Which is why...
                      (points)
                  ...I brought him.

     COLOSSUS steps forward into Angel Dust's path holding a pair
     of Adamantium HANDCUFFS just like he used on Deadpool.

                            COLOSSUS
                  I'd prefer not to hit a woman. So
                  please place your hands behind your-

     BOOM! Without stopping Angel Dust throws a RIGHT HOOK from
     her HEELS. The punch CONNECTS with COLOSSUS's JAW. He goes
     flying, SCRAPING SPARKS ACROSS CONCRETE.

                            DEADPOOL
                      (sighs, points)
                  I also brought her.

     NEGASONIC TEENAGE WARHEAD steps forward on Deadpool's right.

     NTW chews her gum. Once. Twice. Then runs TOWARD Angel
     Dust, LOWERS her SHOULDER, and EXPLODES UP toward her with a
     WICKEDLY THUNDEROUS BANG of ENERGY and SOUND.

     Yes, Negasonic Teenage Warhead is exactly that - a living,
     breathing WARHEAD - like her own personal CANNONBALL.

     It's Angel Dust's turn to go flying backward, smashing into -
     and completely trashing - a heavy metal shipping container.

                            DEADPOOL (CONT'D)
                  I feel sorry for the guy who tries to
                  pressure her into prom sex.

     Angel Dust regains her feet, smiles dangerously at the Mercs.

                            ANGEL DUST
                  Never mind. Fire.


     Deadpool is already moving as the Mercs OPEN FIRE, full-auto.
     Deadpool grabs the still-woozy NTW and runs to the nearby
     cover of metal scrap, keeping between her and the gunfire.

     Colossus, now back on his feet, strides purposely forward.
     Bullets ping harmlessly off his metal skin. Angel Dust
     charges forward, snarling.

                          DEADPOOL
                    (shouts)
                Finish fucking her the fuck up.

     Colossus stops, annoyed.

                            COLOSSUS
                Language.    Please.

     Then Angel Dust SMASHES into him. The two collide with earth-
     shaking force. The sheer power of Angel Dust's momentum
     slams them backwards into-and through-a huge pile of scrap.

   INT.   FLIGHT DECK - DAY                                              

     AJAX pulls VANESSA forward to the edge of the carrier deck,
     forces her gaze downward toward the WAR ZONE below.

                          AJAX
                How does it feel? Ex-boyfriend abandons
                you, becomes a sanity-challenged killer
                mutant in tights...

                          VANESSA
                Says the sanity-challenged killer mutant
                in parachute pants. P.S. I've never
                played the role of damsel in distress.

                            AJAX
                `Til now.

     Ajax yanks Vanessa away from the edge again.

   EXT. SCRAPYARD - CONTINUOUS                                           

     Every MERC is pouring fire towards Deadpool's position. He
     hunkers down with NTW, her hands clamped tight over her ears.

     Deadpool unzips a zipper, reaches into his suit at the
     crotch, YANKS. Grimaces. We hear fabric tear. He pulls his
     hand out, waves a pair of torn TIGHTIE-WHITIES up from behind
     cover.

                            DEADPOOL
                  Hey, fellas, whoa! Hold on!        Don'tcha
                  wanna hear my terms?!

     The mercs spot the white `flag.' Fire slackens from full-
     auto to a few pot-shots. Finally, Deadpool pops up.

                             DEADPOOL (CONT'D)
                  You guys only work for that shit-spackled
                  Muppet fart! So I'm gonna give y'all the
                  chance to lay down your firearms in
                  return for preferential - bordering on
                  gentle - possibly even lover-like
                  treatment.

     The Mercs ignore him, opening fire AGAIN with a vengeance.
     Deadpool ducks and drops his tightie-whities.

                            DEADPOOL (CONT'D)
                  Fine. Commando.
                      (to NTW)
                  Stay down, kid. Unless your power's
                  stopping bullets.

     Deadpool SURGES forward, dives from cover, rolls.            He comes
     up boot knife out, arm whipping forward-

     The nearest merc's head snaps back as the knife buries itself
     to the hilt in his eye socket.

     Deadpool sprints forward, zig-zagging, leaping, spinning as
     he closes the distance to the mercs. He's moving too fast
     for their guns to track. Bullets chew up the ground behind.

     Deadpool reaches the first pile of twisted metal, slides
     under, comes up behind two mercs taking shelter there. The
     first man turns, gun barrel swinging `round. Deadpool ducks,
     sweeps his legs, grabs his gun as he goes down.

     Deadpool rolls over him, firing BACKWARD into the man's face
     while spinning up to smash his boot into the face of the
     second merc. He slides past, firing a burst backward into
     the merc's neck as he falls.

     Seconds later he's leaping OVER the heads of the next pair of
     mercs. They turn to fire up at him - too slow. He fires
     short, controlled bursts down into their upturned faces.
     BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!

     Deadpool lands, tosses the empty smoking gun.          Then slowly,
     lovingly, unsheathes his Katanas.




                                                                  
                                                                     .
                Deadpool      Final Shooting Script   
                                                            

     Deadpool is running forward now, weaving his way through the
     wreckage. Hunting.

   EXT.   SCRAPYARD - DAY                                                 

     COLOSSUS and ANGEL DUST engage in a BATTLE ROYALE. Colossus
     grabs Angel Dust by the SCRUFF of her NECK and HURLS her into
     an ABANDONED AIRCRAFT. CRUNCH.

     Angel Dust is on one knee, shaken, disheveled, one BREAST
     hanging out of her torn flak jacket.

     The prim Colossus covers his eyes.

                          COLOSSUS
                Uh... you seem to have, um...

     Angel Dust smiles, tucks the wayward boob back in, then
     BLASTS Colossus with a FLYING KNEE that generates SHOCK WAVES
     so powerful, Colossus' CHROME actually RIPPLES.

     Colossus growls and CHARGES AGAIN.

                                                                  CUT TO:

     DEADPOOL spins around a corner as another pair of MERCS move
     forward, guns raised.

     Deadpool dives under their fire, guts them in blurred flash
     of steel. THRUST! SLICE! IMPALE! COMPLETE MAYHEM.

     Another trio of mercs rush around the corner, opening fire as
     they see their comrades fall. DEADPOOL runs toward them,
     flips and dodges like a whirling dervish, bringing GUARDS
     down in surgical, artistic fashion, as if where he's killing
     them means as much to him as how.

     Two men converge    on Deadpool. He JUMPS. Mid-air, he flips
     his TWO KATANAS,    GRIPS them upside-down like ICE PICKS, and
     STABS down in an    arc to either side, SKEWERING two men
     through the TOPS    of their HELMETS.

     A final merc comes around the corner and Deadpool spins,
     slices the strap of his gun, kicks the man in the chest,
     knocking him flat on his back and sitting on his face.

                          DEADPOOL
                Tea-bag!
                    (notices man under him)
                Bob?!

                            BOB
                Wade?!


                                                                 
                                                                     .
                  
                                                                

                            DEADPOOL
                  It's been since... Jacksonville!

                            BOB
                  TGIFridays.

                            DEADPOOL
                  Liked the Loaded Potato Skins.     Didn't
                  like you.

                             BOB
                  Ditto.

     Deadpool rises and pulls Bob to his feet. Bob tries to draw
     a pistol but DP slaps it out of his hand, sends it skittering
     away.

                            DEADPOOL
                  Bob, y'mind taking a half-step right?
                  No, your right. Never mind-

     Deadpool KNOCKS Bob OUT with the sword's GRIP, then NUDGES
     him sideways gently as he falls.

     At last, SILENCE. Deadpool steps forward.           Then looks up
     toward the carrier above, waves.

                             DEADPOOL (CONT'D)
                  Yoo-hoo!

     From above, AJAX peers down sees that Deadpool has killed his
     henchmen in such precise positions that their fallen bodies
     spell out:

     FRANCIS.

     Deadpool moves forward.       LIMPING.   CHARRED.   TATTERED.   But
     unbowed.

                            AJAX
                  That never gets old.    But neither will
                  you.

     Right on cue...

     ...three more Mercs appear to either side of Ajax, armed with
     HEAVY MACHINE GUNS - much NASTIER than any we've yet seen.

     BOOM-BOOM-BOOM-BOOM! The guards OPEN FIRE, and a BARRAGE of
     bullets rain down on the scrapyard, chewing up the landscape
     around Deadpool.




                                                                
                                                                   .
               
                                                          

     Deadpool SPRINTS back toward cover, weaving, leaping, zig-
     zagging to avoid being hit. He dives behind some wreckage as
     more gunfire pings off the metal.

     DEADPOOL, pokes his head up, drawing a withering barrage of
     fire from the mercs above.

                           NEGASONIC TEENAGE WARHEAD (O.S.)
               Hey!

     ANGLE ON: NEGASONIC TEENAGE WARHEAD, also taking cover,
     crouched under a broken PLANE WING.

                           NEGASONIC TEENAGE WARHEAD (CONT'D)
               Climb on.

     Deadpool nods, then sprints toward her, springs high, flips,
     and lands on his back, spread eagled on the wing.

                         DEADPOOL
               Light the candle...

     NTW nonchalantly SPITS out her GUM, crouches, and... EXPLODES
     UPWARD. The wing LAUNCHES up in a shallow PARABOLA, Deadpool
     CLINGING for dear life on TOP.

   EXT. FLIGHT DECK - CONTINUOUS                                         

     Four MERCS continue firing down as the wing soars up.

     The WING SMASHES into them.    All four go FLYING.       Two end up
     DEAD under the wing.

     AJAX is thrown backward.

     One MERC lands, stunned, close to the edge.     A LONG BEAT.

     AJAX rises to his feet.

     Then DEADPOOL pulls himself UP over the edge of the carrier
     and ROLLS onto the deck. He looks like he's been through a
     meat grinder - limping, scorched, bloody.

     Deadpool staggers to his feet.    The last injured MERC lamely
     tries to GRAB his ANKLE.

                         DEADPOOL
               Your plan to trip me to death?      Has
               failed.

     Deadpool nonchalantly STABS him through the back of the neck
     like a butterfly on a display, then turns to face Ajax.



                                                              
                                                                      .
                  
                                                                 

     Twenty meters away, AJAX leans casually against... what else?
     THE PUNCH-BOWL. VANESSA is STRAPPED inside, lid open.

                            DEADPOOL (CONT'D)
                  You were right, babe.
                      (wipes blood off sword)
                  Red is my color.

                              VANESSA
                  Wade?

                            AJAX
                      (taps glass)
                  What better way to climb back in your
                  head...

                            DEADPOOL
                  You never left.

                            VANESSA
                      (to Deadpool)
                  But you did, asshole.

                            AJAX
                  You two have a lot to work out. Take a
                  deep breath. Wait. Wrong choice...

     Ajax quickly CLOSES the LID and hits a SWITCH.         Vanessa
     starts taking short, desperate GASPS.

                            AJAX (CONT'D)
                  ...of words.

                            DEADPOOL
                  I hope they blocked pain to your every
                  last nerve. `Cause I'm'a go looking.

     Ajax squats down and picks up TWO STEEL-HAFTED FIRE-FIGHTING
     AXES, each with an ULTRA-SHARP BLADE on one side of its head
     and an EQUALLY SHARP CLAW on the other.

     Deadpool raises a KATANA and HURLS it NOT at Ajax, but the
     PUNCH-BOWL. The blade PENETRATES the PLEXI and tears into
     the RESTRAINT holding Vanessa's RIGHT WRIST, partly FRAYING
     it. AIR seeps through the CRACK. Vanessa catches a tiny
     BREATH. She TUGS on the frayed RESTRAINT.

                            AJAX
                  I hear you grow back parts. When I get
                  done... parts will have to grow back you.

                              DEADPOOL
                  Good one.


                                                                 
                                                                  .
                
                                                         

     A big BOOMING sound from below and then the deck of the
     carrier shakes as if from a mild earthquake. Ajax and
     Deadpool look at each other. Shrug.

                           DEADPOOL (CONT'D)
                Let's dance.
                    (beat)
                And by dance I mean try to kill each
                other.

   EXT.   SCRAPYARD - CONTINUOUS                                       

     BAM!   Below, COLOSSUS delivers a HAYMAKER from hell itself.

     Angel Dust FALLS, then RISES, RIPS OFF the WING of a PLANE,
     and BLASTS Colossus with it... first like a BASEBALL BAT,
     then like a GOLF CLUB, then like a COUNTY FAIR MALLETS you
     use to try to ring a bell. CLANG!

     A battered NTW RACES toward Angel Dust. Angel Dust swings
     the wing, but NTW BASEBALL SLIDES UNDER it and EXPLODES up
     into her chin.

     Angel Dust is lifted off her feet into the side of the
     carrier, BUCKLING some of its supports. NTW rolls aside.

   EXT. FLIGHT DECK - CONTINUOUS                                       

     And now, we get what we've been long been waiting for:

     THE FINAL CLOSE QUARTERS BATTLE between DEADPOOL AND AJAX.
     AXES vs. KATANA, TEN STORIES UP...

     AJAX TAKES a MIGHTY, ROARING SWING with an AXE.

                           DEADPOOL
                Yowww!

     STEEL SINGS as AXE and KATANA meet again and again.        THRUSTS.
     PARRIES. SPARKS FLY!

     THUNK! Deadpool's BLADE passes through Ajax's THIGH and pins
     him to a piece of wreckage.

     CRACK!   Ajax tags Deadpool's head with the FLAT of an axe.

     SNAP! Ajax BREAKS the sword's blade with an AXE, not feeling
     anything as he slides his leg off the sword.

     GASP! VANESSA grits her teeth, pulls against the restraints.
     The thick nylon begins to tear as she saws it against the
     katana blade.



                                                              
                                                                    .
                  
                                                               

     CLANG! AJAX wields both axes in a red blur of painted steel.
     Deadpool snatches up a piece of rusted RAILING from the deck,
     barely blocks Ajax's windmilling swings.

     Finally, Ajax smashes the length of rusty metal from
     Deadpool's hands with one axe, while the sharp CLAW END of
     the other buries itself in Deadpool's FOREARM. Deadpool
     hollers.

     Deadpool's red suit has torn away, and the SKULL of his
     TATTOO bleeds from a HOLE in its FOREHEAD.

     Deadpool GRITS his TEETH and YANKS the AXE from Ajax's grasp.
     A spinning KICK sends the second axe flying after the first.

     Now they're completely unarmed.

                             AJAX
                  Fine.   Fists.

                            DEADPOOL
                  Sounds like your last Saturday night.
                      (smiles)
                  The sense of humor survived.

     AJAX and DEADPOOL TRADE VICIOUS PUNCHES.        It's HAGLER vs.
     HEARNS! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!

     Inspired, VANESSA strains against the torn nylon. RRRRIPPP!
     Her right wrist TEARS FREE. She uses her freed hand to start
     unlatching her other restraints.

     DEADPOOL throws short, blinding PUNCHES - rat-a-tat-tat -
     into AJAX's jaw.

                            DEADPOOL (CONT'D)
                  Since you can't feel it?
                      (holds up an INCISOR)
                  I just knocked out your tooth.

     AJAX snarls, drives a SHOULDER into Deadpool, then MOUNTS him
     and BLUDGEONS his face with HAMMER-LIKE FISTS.

     DEADPOOL is starting to LOSE CONSCIOUSNESS when he turns his
     head to one side and spies the PUNCH-BOWL.

     We RACK FOCUS to VANESSA locking eyes with him from inside.
     Hers is an inspired... and INSPIRING look of LOVE.

     We hear a REPRISE of JOHN DENVER's `I WANT TO LIVE.'




                                                                
                                                                     .
                Deadpool      Final Shooting Script   
                                                            

     VANESSA pushes against the sealed door of the punchbowl with
     all her might. With a squeal of metal the latch breaks, the
     twisted metal flying off the lid as it slams open.

     Vanessa grabs the KATANA, jerks it free with another mighty
     effort. Then slides down the containers toward AJAX. With a
     fierce scream, she PLUNGES the blade into his KIDNEY. The
     blade punches through the other side but Ajax feels no pain,
     YANKS out the katana, and THROWS Vanessa aside violently.

     But it's all the opportunity Deadpool needs. He SURGES with
     energy and throws an THUNDEROUS UPPERCUT, BLASTING Ajax off.

                          JOHN DENVER
                I want to liiiiiive!

   EXT.   SCRAPYARD - DAY                                                 

     Below: WHOOSH, BAM! Angel Dust ducks an exhausted
     Colossus's punch and KICKS him THROUGH another STEEL SUPPORT.
     Colossus COLLAPSES. The carrier GROANS.

     Angel Dust moves in for the KILL.        Only out of nowhere...

     ...NTW strikes her in the chops and EXPLODES, sending the
     larger woman SMASHING into concrete with UNPRECEDENTED FORCE.

     Now it's Angel Dust's turn to be broken, smoking, seemingly
     down for the count. NTW approaches carefully to make certain
     it's all over...

     ...but Angel Dust shoots out an arm and GRABS her... DRAGS
     her in CLOSE... makes to SMASH her head like a walnut.

                          ANGEL DUST
                C'mere, ya little bitch.

     NTW fights back valiantly, PUNCHING fast and hard with
     FLURRIES of ENERGY. Angel Dust is scorched and battered by
     the blows, but her adrenaline and rage SURGE. She grabs NTW
     around the neck, plants her into the ground...

     ...and begins to CHOKE the life out of her.        NTW flails,
     cannot break Angel Dust's grip...

     ...but marshals her last remaining energy to live up to her
     name...

     ...and EXPLODE like an ALMIGHTY WARHEAD.         BOOM!

     CUT WIDE to a GARGANTUAN EXPLOSION.




                                                                 
                                                                    .
                  
                                                               

     The ship SHAKES VIOLENTLY, then starts to LIST at a DANGEROUS
     ANGLE.

   EXT.   FLIGHT DECK / CONTINUOUS                                       

     DEADPOOL and AJAX are trading BLOWS again when the DECK SWAYS
     as if hit by a . EARTHQUAKE. Then with a thunderous,
     shuddering, groaning of metal the whole carrier begins to
     tilt.

     Loose wreckage begins to slide and tumble past. A shipping
     container barrels towards them and Deadpool kicks Ajax
     backwards, right into its path. SLAM! It plows into him and
     carries him with it as it disappears over the side.

     Deadpool scrambles and claws up the tilting floor and grabs
     hold of Vanessa.

     Deadpool looks around frantically...

     ...and then spies the PUNCH-BOWL, sliding toward them.

     Deadpool grabs the side as it slides past and throws VANESSA
     inside and SHUTS the LID for protection...

     They slam into the twisted metal railings at the bottom of
     the deck and hang there. Deadpool swings by one hand and
     stares at the scrapyard below. Huge chunks of metal slide
     and smash past to tumble to the ground a hundred feet below.

     Vanessa hangs onto Deadpool for dear life, her eyes locked on
     his...

                            VANESSA
                  If we survive this.   I'm gonna kill you.

                            DEADPOOL
                  We have so much to catch up on.

     ...as the CARRIER topples in an AVALANCHE of STEEL!

     An EPIC collapse of SHRIEKING METAL. Flying glass. Nearly
     seismic booms. A mushroom CLOUD of thick, black destruction.

                                                       FADE TO BLACK.

   EXT.   SCRAPYARD - RUBBLE PILE - DAY                                  

     Black. A crack of light appears, dust sifting down through
     the beam.




                                                                
                                                                      .
                  
                                                                 

     More light, more dust and debris pattering down onto-some
     kind of scratched glass in front of the lens. Finally a hole
     of bright sky fills the frame.

                                                                   CUT TO:

     COLOSSUS vigorously TOSSING aside MASSIVE SLABS of STEEL as
     he digs through the wreckage, uncovering the PUNCH-BOWL,
     damaged, but intact. The LID CREAKS OPEN - pushed by
     Vanessa's TREMBLING HAND.

     Vanessa climbs out dazed, dusty, coughing.

                               COLOSSUS
                  You're OK.     Take it slow.

     Elsewhere in the rubble pile DEADPOOL's HEAD POPS UP from
     some DEBRIS, again, like the Caddyshack gopher.

                               DEADPOOL
                  I'm good.

     Deadpool is just staggering to his feet when AJAX emerges
     from under another BEAM and TACKLES him.

                            DEADPOOL (CONT'D)
                  Â¡Caramba!
                      (subtitled, in YELLOW:)
                  For heaven's sake!

     The impact sends them both flying, rolling, over the edge of
     a metal container. They fall locked together, punching and
     grappling. They bounce/slide down the pile of rubble.

     Deadpool gets the better of the grappling and lands on AJAX's
     CHEST. He goes to TOWN with vicious FOREARMS and ELBOWS.

                             DEADPOOL (CONT'D)
                  Wham!   Wham! Wham!

     BAM! BAM! BAM. Bam. You can feel Deadpool's adrenalized
     catharsis. Ajax tries to block-CRACK! Deadpool shatters his
     elbow. Ajax other fist swings round, tags Deadpool, but he
     catches it, wraps it tight-SNAP!

     Ajax finally goes limp, both arms bent in horribly wrong
     directions.

                            DEADPOOL (CONT'D)
                      (thrilled/exhausted)
                  There are no words.




                                                                  
                                                                     .
               Deadpool       Final Shooting Script   
                                                            

     Deadpool pulls out BLIND AL's SATURDAY NIGHT SPECIAL and AIMS
     it right BETWEEN AJAX's EYES.

                          DEADPOOL (CONT'D)
               Me and you are headed to fix this face.
               Or else...

     Deadpool places a piece of paper onto Ajax's chest.

     Ajax shakes off the cobwebs and examines the paper; it's
     Deadpool's CRAYON DRAWING of Ajax getting his brains blown
     out. Ajax actually LAUGHS.

                         AJAX
               Sorry. It's just. All this time, you
               bought that I have the cure? I'm
               flattered. But do I really look like the
               scientist type? You want the guy behind
               the guy. His name's Dr. Killebrew. And
               he's long gone. Who knows where.

                              DEADPOOL
               Um.    What?

                         AJAX
               You heard me.

                         DEADPOOL
               You mean to say, after five long years,
               I've been chasing the wrong monkey?

                         AJAX
               Sounds even stupider when you say it.

                          DEADPOOL
               Like the kind of stupid who admits he
               can't do the one thing I'm keeping him
               alive for?
                   (chambers a round)
               Any last words? Good. I got one:
                   (pulls back the hammer)
               Francis.

                              COLOSSUS (O.S.)
               Wade!

     Deadpool turns to see Colossus, hands on hips, looking extra
     HEROIC. NEGASONIC TEENAGE WARHEAD is STANDING at his SIDE.

                         COLOSSUS (CONT'D)
               Four or five moments.




                                                                 
                                                                    .
                
                                                           

                             DEADPOOL
                I'm sorry?

                          COLOSSUS
                Four or five moments.      That's all it
                takes...

                             DEADPOOL
                To...?

                          COLOSSUS
                Be a hero. Everyone thinks it's a full
                time job. Wake up a hero. Brush your
                teeth a hero. Go to work a hero. Not
                true. Over a lifetime, there are only
                four or five moments that really matter.
                Moments when you're offered a choice. To
                make a sacrifice. Conquer a flaw. Save
                a friend. Spare an enemy.

     Deadpool continues to hold the pistol to Ajax's head.

                          COLOSSUS (CONT'D)
                In those moments, everything else falls
                away. The way the world sees us. The
                way we see oursel-

     BOOM!   OFF-SCREEN, A GUNSHOT.

                          COLOSSUS (CONT'D)
                    (dry-heaves again)
                Huuugglh! Why!

     REVERSE ANGLE to Deadpool, who's just shot AJAX in the head
     with Blind Al's SATURDAY NIGHT SPECIAL.

                          DEADPOOL
                You were droning on!
                    (shrugs)
                I may be stuck looking like pepperoni
                flatbread, but at least we've heard the
                last of him. If wearing super-hero
                tights means sparing psychopaths, maybe I
                wasn't meant to wear `em. Not everyone
                monitors a hall like you.

                          COLOSSUS
                Just promise-

                          DEADPOOL
                I'll be on the lookout for the next four
                moments.

                   (peers between Colossus and
                    NTW)
               Now if you'll excuse me. I'm just a
               boy... about to stand in front of a
               girl... and tell her- what the fuck am I
               gonna tell her?!

     CUT TO: Deadpool's P.O.V. BETWEEN Colossus and NTW of
     VANESSA, who's now walking quickly TOWARD him. She brushes
     between the two X-men and without saying a word, GRABS the
     fallen PISTOL and PUMPS TWO EXTRA BULLETS into Ajax's corpse.

                          VANESSA
                   (bang)
               Gratuitous.
                   (bang)
               Worth it.

                         DEADPOOL
                   (to camera)
               Anyone else turned on?
                   (to Vanessa)
               That's what I love about y-

     Vanessa promptly PUNCHES Deadpool in the face.

                         DEADPOOL (CONT'D)
               I totally deserved that!
                   (gets punched again)
               That too!
                   (wards off knee)
               Maybe not the nethers.

     Vanessa restrains herself, then TURNS HER BACK, overcome.

                         VANESSA
               Start talking.

                          DEADPOOL
               I'm so sorry. For leaving. And taking
               so long to cowboy up. It's been a rough
               few years.

                         VANESSA
                   (snorts, dismissive)
               Rough?

                         DEADPOOL
               I live in a crack house. With a family
               of twelve. At night, we spoon for
               warmth. Everyone fights for Noelle.
               She's the fattest.

                         DEADPOOL (CONT'D)
               There's nothing we don't share.    Floor
               space. Dental floss. Condoms.

                         VANESSA
               So you live in a house!
                   (turns to face him)

                         DEADPOOL
               I woulda found you before now. But the
               guy behind this mask isn't the same guy
               you remember.

                         VANESSA
               You mean this mask?

     Deadpool FLINCHES but doesn't STOP Vanessa from slowly,
     gently taking OFF his mask, revealing underneath... HUGH
     JACKMAN's `SEXIEST MAN ALIVE' People MAGAZINE COVER. Blood
     at the pierce points. Mouth/eyes cut out to make a `mask.'

                         DEADPOOL
               And this one. In case the other fell
               off.

                         VANESSA
               You mean like this?

     Vanessa starts PULLING OUT staples.

                          DEADPOOL
               Oo. Ah.    Quicker - like a Bandaid!    Owww-
               di .

     One last staple remains.   Vanessa hesitates.

                          DEADPOOL (CONT'D)
               Sure?

                         VANESSA
               Sure I'm sure.

     She PULLS it out. The photo FALLS, revealing DEADPOOL's
     SCARS. And two vulnerable, misty eyes. A beat.

                          VANESSA (CONT'D)
               Ew.

                         DEADPOOL
                   (devastated)
               I understand.

               Kidding! Get over yourself!        I'd hit
               that shit.

                         DEADPOOL
               You already did.
                   (rubs chin)
               Twice. Seriously?

                          VANESSA
                   (nods)
               After a brief adjustment period and one
               or two drinks.
                   (smiles)
               It's a face... I'd be happy to sit on.

     Vanessa hooks Deadpool's PINKIE with HERS, PULLS him in to
     kiss him.

                         DEADPOOL
               I'm also not the same under these pants.
                   (whispers)
               Super-penis.

     Deadpool and Vanessa are ABOUT to kiss when...

                         NEGASONIC TEENAGE WARHEAD (O.S.)
                called.

     Deadpool realizes COLOSSUS and NTW are still standing

               It wants its peep show back.

                         DEADPOOL
               Gah! What the hell are you two still
               doing here?!
                   (to Colossus)
               You, go clean some chalk-board erasers,
               or be a... really Big Brother, or teach
               fat kids to eat lettuce.

               And you, Chicken Noodle. Well...
                   (freezes)
               I feel something stupid coming on.
                   (bounces)
               Gaaaaaaahhhhhh!

               You're cool.

                   (STARES, elated)
               I am?! Omigod. That. Was. Not. Mean!
               Seriously, guys, it was a pleasure. For
               a second there, we felt like... like...
                   (we expect `family')
               ...five mini lion robots forming a large
               super robot.

                         DEADPOOL
               Now, I meant it, both of you, fire up the
               Blackbird and shoo! Scram! Vamoose!
               Skedaddle! Don't make me keep thinking
               of these!

     They smile, shake their heads, and walk off.

     Deadpool turns back to Vanessa.

                         DEADPOOL (CONT'D)
               Where were we, darlin'? Oh, riiight.
               The best part.

     Deadpool KISSES Vanessa. The little kiss become a BIGGER
     ONE. Then... fading up from nowhere, with a slightly tinny
     quality... we hear WHAM!'s `CARELESS WHISPER.' Vanessa pulls
     back, puzzled. Deadpool raises his ANDROID. On the cracked
     and dirty screen, George's and Andrew's FACES beam from
     Wham!'s `MAKE IT BIG' album cover.

                           DEADPOOL (CONT'D)
               `Wham!'    As promised.

     We find ourselves in a newer, spiffier version of the
     WORKSHOP, where a LAB TECHNICIAN is strapping down a new
     sickly VOLUNTEER/VICTIM.

                          DEADPOOL (V.O.)
                Which brings us to shittiest moment
                number ! The guy behind the guy, Dr.
                Killebrew, off scot-free.

     A SILHOUETTED FIGURE approaches the bed of the nervous
     volunteer, who smiles weakly.

                          VOLUNTEER
                Can you make me better?

     REVERSE ANGLE to reveal whom he's talking to: the PUDGY,
     KINDLY-LOOKING DOCTOR WHO STROKED WADE'S HEAD IN THE
     WORKSHOP. He smiles, pats the volunteer's wrist.

                          DR. KILLEBREW
                Better than better.

     Dr. Killebrew holds up a syringe with a glint in his eye.

                 Wait... you expected a tease for Deadpool
                 ?! Sorry, we're low on dough. But if
                 you can keep a secret, I can tell you
                 who's gonna be in it. Cable! Someone
                 suggested Mel Gibson for the role, buuuut-
                 I was thinking Liam Neeson. Only
                 problem, Liam likes to get paid. And
                 more for Liam means less for me. Maybe
                 we'll crowdfund the shit. Just you and
                 me, kids. Shalom!

EXT. CAMP - DAY

       UP ON the door of a weathered cattle car as a German
       soldier steps into frame wearing that familiar gray of
       the all-too familiar era.

       He throws the door to reveal a mass of huddled and
       frightened people inside.

       The words are not necessary.  The language is not ours
       and the images say enough.

       Men, women and children are herded off the train like
       cattle toward a large open yard.  There they huddle until
       the Germans begin to shout and shove through the mob.

       EXT. FENCE CORRIDOR - DAY

       We are looking up at rows and rows of fences topped with
       barbed wire all designed to create a separator for the
       thousands of Jew who pour through each day.

       Then we see the eyes themselves that look up at them.

       A LITTLE BOY.  A boy who will not die this day.  A boy
       who will live to see the end of the war and the world of
       the future.

       He stares at the metal wire with an unusual fascination.

       The boy looks up at HIS WORRIED PARENTS - a sturdy-
       looking couple who try to smile and comfort him.

       The corridor comes to a junction where it splits in
       several different directions.

       Soldiers here push the mob using rifles as pikes,
       screaming and terrorizing the lot of them.  Suddenly it
       is clear what they are doing.  They are dividing the mob
       into smaller groups.

       Soon, the groups themselves become evident.

       Men from women.  Children from adults.

       The family tries to stay together, clinging to one
       another dearly, until finally, they are put upon by a
       number of gray uniforms and pulled apart. The boy is
       dragged screaming his feet no longer touching the ground.
       Two soldiers carry him as they follow the back of a large
       column of children being led through a gate of barbed
       wire so dense, it resembles wool.

       The gate closes and the boy looks back to see his parents
       - along with many others - being restrained by a number
       of soldiers.  The screaming is deafening.

       And the boy's can be heard above it all.  The soldiers
       seem to be having a hard time carrying such a frail
       child.  The farther they get from the fence, the heavier
       he seems to get, until they are literally pulling him as
       though he were anchored to something.

       His outstretched fingers claw at the thin air and he
       screams until the blood in his face is blue.

       The soldiers are literally pulled back a step and they
       begin to slip in the mud. They look at one another and
       then over their shoulders as they hear a sound.

       A groaning, creaking sound.  And then the unmistakable
       twang of wire stretched to snapping.

       ANGLE ON:

       The fence.  The gate that separates the parents.  It bows
       toward them like iron filings to a magnet, and several of
       the strands of barbed wire have given way.

       The boy continues to scream as all the other faces simply
       freeze and wonder.

       One of the soldiers pulls a wooden baton from his belt
       and brains the boy violently.

       He slumps and the soldiers carrying him spring forward as
       through a rope that was holding them back has been cut.
       They nearly fall, looking at one another with some
       concern, some confusion....

       Then they follow the line of children that has gotten
       ahead of them.

       ANGLE ON:

       The boy's parents watch him as he -- as they, are taken
       away.

       The rest of their story is as you would expect.

       EXT. SKY - DAY

       Bright, bright blue framing a blinding white sun.

       PAN DOWN AGAIN TO REVEAL:

       The cracked, drought-stricken soil of nowhere.

       TITLES:

       KENYA - 1978

       A group of children at play.  Tribal children who,
       without the help of the titles, could be from any age.

       They run through a tiny village of tents, playing.  Every
       child holds a long reed-like stick and they chase each
       other playing their version of tag.

       As each child is tapped, they chase the others.  Each
       trying to avoid being "it", though never going far enough
       away to miss the fun.

       One girl in particular.  A PRETTY GIRL OF 12, with
       unusual white hair, is tagged and immediately shunned.

       She chases kids this way and that, but to no avail.  She
       is not strong enough, nor agile enough, to win.

       She tumbles and lands on her stick, snapping it.  She
       stands and, when the children see that her stick is
       broken, they begin to giggle.

       The giggles become laughter and the laughter becomes a
       taunt, and before we even realize, the inherent cruelty
       of children let loose becomes evident.

       They have now formed a circle, at first avoiding her
       touch with distance, but now growing tighter with menace.
       In the unspoken manner of children at prey, the group
       begins to chant in their native tongue - a song we have
       not heard but sung in a way none-too inviting.  They
       begin to poke at her with the reeds, driving her back.

       The girl now moves to the center of the circle, no longer
       wishing to tag anyone.

       ONE DEVIOUS CHILD seems to get an idea.  He takes his
       stick and smacks it across her shoulder.  She turns to
       face the child and another swings his stick across her
       back with a solid THWACK.  Before long, mob rule gives
       way and all the kids are swinging at her and laughing.

       It grows to the brink of frenzy, the laughing and the
       shouting not too unlike the noise of the previous scene.

       So much so, we may miss the first flake of snow.  The
       children certainly do.  It is snowing for a good ten
       seconds before the last of them stops.

       By then, the snow is thick as flies and wafting down to
       melt instantly on the hot African soil that has never
       seen snow before.

       ANGLE ON:

       Adults come out of their huts and in from the fields and
       the whole of the village is soon gathered around the
       little girl, staring up from the clear blue sky and the
       snow that falls from nowhere.  From nothing.

       One by one, all eyes fall on the little girl and the
       looks of curiosity become looks of fear.  Of
       superstition.

       Punctuated by a solid thump.

       And then another.

       AN OLD MAN looks down at his feet and sees a tiny,
       misshapen ball of ice, no bigger than his eye.  He looks
       at it, bites it, then pops it in his mouth - breath
       turning to steam.

       Another such chunk of ice pops him on the head.  THE
       CROWD LAUGHS.

       They look up again and see that mixed with the snow are
       tiny pellets of hail, seeming to increase in number as
       the snow mysteriously wanes.

       And the pellets are getting larger.  Until they land as
       hunks.

       The white haired girl drops to the ground and covers her
       head as hailstones the size of baseballs plow into the
       Earth.

       Before long, tents are collapsing and panic ensues.

       And all along the white haired girl sits huddled in the
       dust, crying.

       As hailstones fall in a circle around her, never coming
       closer than then a few feet or so.

       INT.  HIGH SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - NIGHT

       ONE MORE SKY.  This one a backdrop.  Cheap paint and
       tissue paper hung with hooks on a wall just behind the
       basket on a full court.

       As we pull back, we see the skyline of New York, crudely
       made out with its silhouette buildings of dark gray and
       black - windows of yellow.

       Among the famous landmarks represented is the Statue of
       Liberty, complete with a real light bulb burning in the
       torch.

       We are at a prom. The theme is RHAPSODY IN BLUE and the
       decor has made tragic efforts to show it.  The
       tablecloths are blue, the napkins are blue - far too many
       of the tuxes are powder blue, and the blue eye shadow is
       as heavy as expected.

       Peter Gabriel's "In Your Eyes" gives painful indication
       of the era, but here it is, nonetheless:

       SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA - 1986

       MOVE ACROSS THE FLOOR and through the swaying, clutching,
       sweating dancers to the bathroom.

       Through the door to the usual -

       INT.  BOYS BATHROOM - NIGHT

       Several boys are here, bow ties undone - unclipped in
       most cases.  Smoking, drinking from whatever inventive
       container was used to smuggle in booze.  Breath freshener
       and Visine are the chaser.

       Some of the guys are rolling joints while others make the
       sad effort to wave smoke away.  Who are they kidding?
       It's a fog in here.

       MOVE DOWN THE ROW OF TOILET STALLS to one in particular.
       Here we find A FRECKLED KID standing in front of mirror,
       clearly holding himself up from the effect of God knows
       what.

       He talks to his friend in the he stall behind him.

                           FRECKLED KID
                 Man, what's the matter with you?

       His friend is on the toilet with his head in his hands.
       He seems to be in some pain.  He is SCOTT SUMMERS - AGE
       17.

                           FRECKLED KID (contÃ­d)
                 Dude.  Lighten up.  She's just a girl.
                 You just gotta-

                           SCOTT
                 No, my eyes... my eyes are killing me.

       The Freckled kid offers a small plastic bottle.

                           FRECKLED KID
                 You want some Visine, man?

                           SCOTT
                 My... eyes...

       The freckled kid looks and sees that Scott's eyes are
       watering so badly that tears are literally streaming
       through his fingers.

       He goes back to the mirror to look at his own.

                           SCOTT
                 ... they're burning...

       The freckled kid turns back to him.

                           FRECKLED KID
                 Dude, how much did you smoke?

                           SCOTT
                 I didn't smoke anything.

       Scott looks up, taking his hands away, revealing for an
       instant that his eyes are merely bright red embers in his
       head.  Featureless but for the color.

       Freckles takes a step back.

       INT. GYM - OUTSIDE BOYS ROOM - NIGHT

       A blinding flash of light shows through the frosted glass
       in the double door and cuts through the crack into the
       dark of the gym.

       All who see it are stunned. Frozen.  A lingering moment
       of confusion, then:

       BOOM, the doors to the Boys Room burst open and the
       occupants scatter into the gym.

       INT. GYM - STALL - NIGHT

       Freckles is still there, legs locked.

       FRECKLES' P.O.V.

       He looks at Scott who is now crying meekly in the stall,
       covering his eyes again -- afraid to open them.

       The door of the stall across from him swings closed TO
       REVEAL:

       A HOLE, PUNCHED THROUGH THE STALL DOOR framing Scott's
       face perfectly.  Pull back to reveal that the hole
       continues through the wall, into the girl's bathroom next
       door.

       In the corner several girls huddle together, they are
       afraid.

       INT. SENATE HEARING ROOM - DAY

       Packed with reporters and photographers.  There's a dais -
       a raised panel of senators - and a second, lower panel.
       This is where the "experts" are testifying.

       Panning across the faces of several G.O.P. creeps as they
       watch something with varying degrees of interest.

       TITLES:

       WASHINGTON D.C. - THE NOT TOO DISTANT FUTURE

       A woman's voice holds over the proceedings.  It is the
       voice of JEAN GREY - whom we will soon meet.

       As she is speaking, we come to a large screen television
       at one end of the room.

                           JEAN (O.S.)
                 In every organism on Earth there
                 exists a mutator gene - the X-factor,
                 as it has come to be known.  It is the
                 basic building block of evolution -
                 the reason we have evolved from homo
                 habilus...

       FOOTAGE REFLECTS THE VARIOUS STAGES OF HUMAN EVOLUTION.
       Accompanying it is a GRAPH with a DIAGONAL LINE
       indicating the ascent of the "human being" as we know it.
       Accompanying the graph are evolving images of the
       "evolution of man."

                           JEAN (O.S.) (contÃ­d)
                 ... to homo erectus, to homo sapiens
                 Neanderthals, and, finally, to homo
                 sapiens.

       The animated demo on the screen zooms in on the lowest
       order of human depicted - homo habilus - a primitive, ape-
       like humanoid covered in hair.  As he is singled out, the
       terrain of his time appears, along with the harsh signs
       of his winter.

                           JEAN (O.S.) (contÃ­d)
                 Taking it's cues from the climate,
                 terrain, various sources of
                 nourishment, the mutator gene tells
                 the body when it needs to change to
                 adapt to a new environment.  The
                 process is subtle, normally taking
                 thousands of years.

       As the graphic changes and depicts WARMER CLIMATE, the
       HAIR STARTS TO DISAPPEAR ON THE MAN'S BODY - gradually
       evolving into the human we now know as ourselves.

       Now the terrain is modern, the weather pleasant.  The
       image pulls back and places this man back in line at the
       front of evolution.

                           JEAN (O.S.) (contÃ­d)
                 Only in the last few thousand years
                 did mankind begin to make clothes for
                 himself, build shelters, use heat and
                 grow food in large quantities.  With
                 this man-made environment remaining
                 relatively stable, the X-factor became
                 dormant.

       QUICK SHOTS: early huts, early clothing; then early
       homes, later homes, air conditioning, cars, modern high-
       rises, etc.

       PULL BACK WIDER

                           JEAN (O.S.) (contÃ­d)
                 Until now.

       On the room, the reactions, and on JEAN herself.

       A strong, attractive woman in her early 30's.  A simple
       placard before her:

       JEAN GREY.  GENETICALLY ENHANCED RIGHTS ASSOCIATION.

       The screen shows the words "PRESENT DAY," where the
       "evolution line" has resumed its rise.

                           JEAN (contÃ­d)
                 For reasons still not known to us, we
                 are seeing what some are calling the
                 beginnings of another stage of
                 evolution -

       A MICROPHONED VOICE interrupts.  Bearing down is the
       flamboyant SENATOR SCOTT "FRANK" KELLY, a conservative
       from Florida, and the hearing's Chairman.

       Just behind him sits his aide HENRY GUYRICH - mid 30's,
       typical government cog.

                           KELLY
                 You're avoiding the question I posed
                 to you at the beginning of the
                 hearing, Ms. Grey.  Three words: Are
                 mutants dangerous?

                           JEAN
                 I am avoiding a question that is
                 decidedly loaded, Senator.  The wrong
                 person behind the wheel of a car can
                 be dangerous.

       Another SENATOR (LUCINDA ROWEE) speaks into her
       microphone:

                           SENATOR ROWEE
                 Well, we do license people to drive.

                           JEAN
                 But not to live.

       Kelly raises a hand, continuing his tirade.

                           KELLY
                 Ms. Grey -- you work at a school for
                 mutants in Westchester, New York.  Can
                 you tell the members of this committee
                 what exactly you are teaching these
                 mutants?

                           JEAN
                 Math.  History.  Science.  English.
                 Athletics --

                           KELLY
                 You wouldn't happen to be teaching
                 them how to use their powers to --

                           JEAN
                 Control, Senator...  we teach them
                 control.

       Kelly raises a blown-up photograph: a grainy, super-
       zoomed, somewhat obscured image of a CAR ON A FREEWAY
       which appears to have "melted."  Now he's really playing
       to the crowd.

                           KELLY
                 This was taken by a state police
                 officer in Secaucus, New Jersey.  A
                 man in a minor altercation literally
                 melted the car in front of him.  I
                 don't know where you come from, Ms.
                 Grey, but where I come from, you don't
                 go melting people's cars when they cut
                 you off.  You do it the old fashioned
                 way -- you give 'em the finger.
                     (laughs from the crowd)
                 But what you presume to tell this
                 committee -

                           JEAN
                 I presume nothing, I am here to tell
                 you that in time, the mutator gene
                 will activate in every living human
                 being on this planet.  Perhaps even
                 your children, Senator.

                           KELLY
                 I can assure you, there is no such
                 creature in my genes.

       The room LAUGHS.  Kelly mistaken thinks it is for him,
       until the double meaning occurs to him.  He is
       momentarily embarrassed, but he quickly recovers.

                           KELLY (contÃ­d)
                 Ms. Grey, we are not here to weed out
                 mutants.  The Registration Act is
                 designed merely to assess their
                 potential threat - if any - to
                 national security.

       The crowd reacts loudly in support of the Senator.  Some
       cheer, some roar, some yell obscenities at Jean.

       Jean stands and walks out, pushing her way through
       reporters now moving in for her response. All the while,
       Kelly is delivering his last words.

                           KELLY (contÃ­d)
                 Mutants are very real.  They are among
                 us.  We must know who they are.  And
                 above all, we must know what they can
                 do.

       AS THE SHOUTS OF THE MOB RISE AND GIVE WAY TO:

       EXT.  CAPITOL BUILDING - WASHINGTON D.C. - DAY

       An angry mob outside the Senate hearing.  Voices roar in
       dissent when Jean emerges, coming down the steps without
       hesitation.

       She sees signs condemning mutants, a scarce few
       supporting them.

       A group of reporters are behind her and more meet her in
       front, closing her in.  Microphones are shove in her
       face.

                           REPORTERS/VARIOUS
                 Dr. Grey, how do you feel about the
                 Senator's Statement / How is the
                 mutant community reacting?  Is it true
                 that mutants are dangerous? / Is there
                 a mutant plot to overthrow the
                 government?

       She ignores them all, trying to push through.

       ANGLE ON:

       A KID IN THE CROWD holding a full can of Coke.  Smiling
       to his friend beside him.  He fires it over the heads of
       everyone toward Jean.  Perfect trajectory.  Closing fast.

       Suddenly:

       Silence falls over the crowd.  A total silence.  An
       absolute silence.

       All eyes watch in awe at the can and its liquid trail,
       frozen in mid-air a few inches from Jean's face.  It
       simply hovers there.

                           JEAN
                 WeÃ­re not the ones to be afraid of.

       Using telekinesis she slowly lowers the can to the
       ground.  She shakes her head, almost ashamed of the
       display.  Almost as if to say Ã¬I didnÃ­t want to do that.Ã®

       The can rolls down the steps.  People move away from it
       as though the can itself were dangerous.

       The crowd steps back in genuine fear.  Jean simply moves
       ahead now, unimpeded, still shaking her head.

       EXT. CABIN IN THE SNOW COVERED WILDERNESS - DAY

       Smoke curling from the chimney, warm light emanating from
       the window.

       A well-worn pick-up truck parked axles deep in the snow,
       the back filled with a cord of cut wood.  A hand painted
       scrawl on the door reads:

       Firewood for Sales

       A slope, just behind the cabin leading to a frozen lake.

       PUSH IN SLOWLY TOWARDS THE CABIN.  Ten beers sit cooling
       in the snow outside the door.  We hear LED ZEPPELINÃ­S
       Ã¬BLACK DOG.Ã®

       INT. CABIN - DAY

       Music thunders, quite a contrast to the surroundings.  A
       cosy little abode, showing signs of neglect, as though
       decorated with a gentler touch that passed not too long
       ago.

       A large shelf replete with books.  An electric mix from
       Sun TsuÃ­s The Art of War to Mark TwainÃ­s The Adventures
       of Huckleberry Finn.

       A fire burns in the fireplace.  On the mantle sit a few
       old black and white photos of a slightly younger Logan
       posing with a group of HARD-CASE MILITARY TYPES in a
       heavily wooded area.  We can not tell if they are true
       Military or simply mercenaries.

       In the wall above the mantle, a sketch of a beautiful
       woman.

       And finally we come to the occupant of the house, sitting
       at the only table in the center of the room.  His back is
       to us.  His hair is coarse and black, sprouting wildly
       from his head.  He is LOGAN.  We will come to know him
       well.  As well as we can.

       Despite the loud, pounding music, he is working with the
       meticulousness of a watch maker.  At the same time, he
       smokes a thick cigar.  A tall bottle of beer on the floor
       next to his chair.  A SINGLE, SILVER DOG TAG hangs from
       his neck from a battered chain.  As we get closer, we
       look over his shoulder and see what he is working on so
       intensely.

       Pencil rubs against paper furiously.  He is sketching,
       what we cannot see.  But he is definitely caught up in
       his own minds eye.

       HIS HEAD SUDDENLY TURNS.  He listens to something we
       cannot begin to hear.   A momentary pause, and he goes
       back to sketching.

       Just as he seems to be settling back into the details
       again.

       WHACK

       He reaches over and shuts off the music coming from the
       box beside him.  He listens.

       He stands, turning around slowly in a circle.  He drops
       the sketch pad on the chair.

       Only the crackle of logs in the fire.

       LOGANÃ­S P.O.V.

       We follow his gaze around the room.  Past the fire which
       sounds suddenly like a blazing inferno, past the clock
       which ticks as loud as clapping hands, past the simmering
       tea-kettle which hisses like a seething cauldron.
       Finally, he glances at the cigar which we hear crackling
       nearly as loud as the fire.

       LoganÃ­s senses are amplified many times more then ours,
       he walks to the door.

       E.C.U.

       His nostrils flare.

       He raises his fist beside his face.  For a moment, it
       seems as if he is just chinking.  Then -- SHOOK - THREE
       STEELY CLAWS some nine inches long, emerge inexplicably
       from the skin just above LoganÃ­s knuckles.

       Logan barley turns his head before.

       BOOM

       THE WINDOW EXPLODES, letting in freezing wind and
       billowing snow.

       Logan is hit from behind.

       The attack is so ferocious that we are unable to make out
       the attacker.  Whatever it is, it is HUGE.  We can hear
       it snarling and see flashes of its claws as it slams
       Logan back.

       EXT. CABIN - DAY

       The front door SMASHES OPEN.  The two combatants roll
       madly down the hill obscured by flying snow.

       Finally, we see Logan separate from his attacker and
       CRASH THROUGH THE ICE of the frozen lake.

       E.C.U. - A MASSIVE CLAW-LIKE HAND lifts into frame the
       SHINING DOG TAG hanging from it.  The tagÃ­s chain slides
       off and too the ground.

       UNDER ICE

       Logan struggles, already short of breath.

       As he struggles -- water starts to fill his lungs.  His
       skin goes pale.  He is drowning.

       EXT. ABOVE ICE - DAY

       We hear an angry grunt as the thing starts to hunt for
       Logan.  It stalks across the ice, searching.  We catch a
       glimpse of shoulder, a CLAWED FOOT, a MANE OF HAIR.

       UNDER ICE

       LoganÃ­s struggle has decreased somewhat as his strength
       wanes.

       CRACK

       The ice above Logan shatters as a clawed hand reaches
       through.

       EXT. ABOVE ICE - DAY

       A violent YANK.  The ice gives way to the soaked and half-
       frozen Logan.

       The creature picks Logan up by his face, CUTTING DEEPLY
       into his cheek, and holds him up like a rag doll.  The
       two are face to face.  This is called SABRETOOTH.  The
       reasons are obvious.

       Teeth like said animal and catÃ­s eyes to match.

       A mutant, certainly a member of a class remote in the
       extreme.

       And then it speaks.

                           SABRETOOTH
                 ItÃ­s not gonna be that easy.

       Logan, half-drowned, opens his eyes and looks right at
       Sabretooth as though heÃ­s going to say something.
       Instead, a LUNG-FULL OF WATER comes shooting out.

       With that, Sabretooth ROARS, as he hoists Logan up and
       throws him.  Logan flies nearly ten yards.  He lands head
       first.

       Sabretooth skulks over to him.

       With the sound of SabretoothÃ­s breathing comes the rising
       of the wind...

       Snow from the ground begins to swirl in the bitter cold
       air.

       Sabretooth is nearly upon Logan now and the wind rises
       further, until he must shield his eyes from the bitter
       icy air.

       As he approaches, we see a fresh cut on LoganÃ­s face
       HEALING BEFORE OUR VERY EYES, leaving not so much as a
       scratch.

       THEN:

       A SUDDEN FLASH OF LIGHT

       Lightning.  No.  Lightning is not red.

       Sabretooth looks around, puzzled, then down at LoganÃ­s
       motionless body.  Then to his feet where a hole in the
       ice sprouts bubbling water.

       The wind blows so violently now that he nearly misses two
       figures standing only a few yards away - mere silhouettes
       in the icy haze.

       A closer look tells us it is a man and a woman, THEY WEAR
       STRANGE UNIFORMS of form-fitting material - the man wears
       a reflective visor that hides his eyes.  The womanÃ­s face
       is care revealing dark skin, penetrating eyes and unusual
       white hair.

       ANOTHER FLASH - one that seems to come from the manÃ­s
       visor itself.  An intense beam of red light.

       Sabretooth looks down and sees the ice at his feet has
       broken away.

       He plunges through the ice like a mark in a carnival
       dunking tank.  His massive weight and hairy coat quickly
       suck him down.

       The TWO FIGURES - CYCLOPS (Scott Summers) AND STORM
       (Ororo Munroe) - obviously two of the children we saw
       earlier now grown - move over the hole and calmly watch
       Sabretooth gather himself and swim back to the surface.

       Storm looks down at the hole, concentrating her intense
       gaze.  The wind whips further and the water in the hole
       begins to freeze over.

       UNDER THE ICE

       Sabretooth wisely concedes.

       With one last look at the two mysterious figures now
       nearly obscured by the ice, he turns his body and swims
       away with the same agility he had on land.

       ABOVE THE ICE

       THE SNOW AND WIND ARE NOW VIOLENTLY RAGING

       Cyclops and Storm walk over to Logan and look down at him
       curiously.

       LOGANÃ­S P.O.V.

       They look at one another, wondering.  Above them, a black
       shape looms into frame, bringing with it the whining of
       jet engines.

       This is the X-JET and it is like no other plane we have
       seen before.

       LoganÃ­s eyes begin to close as they obscure the last of
       all perceptible detail.

       INT. CAVERNOUS ROOM - NIGHT

       CLOSE UP ON:

       The Periodic Table of Elements.  A chart made up of
       blocks depicting the elements and their chemical symbols.

       Among the standards like Gold (Au) and Iron (I) and
       Oxygen (O2) is a new square on simple red construction
       paper tacked to the top.

       It contains simply a large letter Ã¬A.Ã®

       TRACKING SHOT THROUGH:

       We are in a laboratory of sorts, quite different from any
       we have ever seen -- and so are its occupants.

       MORTIMER TOYNBEE, a dim, loyal thug whose agile leaping
       ability and superhuman strength have earned him the name
       TOAD.

       Across the room, JOHN ALLERDYCE, a wiry redhead whose
       ability to control fire with his fingers has earned him
       the name PYRO.

       In the corner we see BLOB, no explanation needed,
       devouring a BUCKET of cereal, preariously balanced on his
       huge belly.

       They are a bestial and sinister bunch.

       Toad and Pyro are working on:

       A MACHINE

       A fantastic device which occupies a hallowed space in
       this lab.  It is meticulously designed, and with its
       intricate circuitry, wires, and power boards, it
       resembles most closely (and only resembles, because truly
       itÃ­s like nothing weÃ­ve ever seen before) a combination
       of an upright torpedo and a fantastic light source --
       only far more dark and foreboding.

       Pyro holds a stick of solder in one hand.  He lights a
       lighter with the other, then drops it.  Strange thing --
       the flame remains hovering about his finger.  Quickly the
       flame intensifies and turns blue, melting the solder over
       a small circuit board.  Then, the flame is gone.

       He sticks out his hand like a surgeon.

                           PYRO
                 Hand me the dykes.

       Toad, both hands occupied, flicks his long tongue and
       grabs a pair of pliers which he rests in PyroÃ­s hand,
       leaving them slicked with SLIME.  The flame in his finger
       goes out.  The slimy coat over the pliers quickly
       HARDENS, freezing their action.

                           PYRO (contÃ­d)
                 I asked you not to do that.

       Blob laughs.  Toad shrugs.

       In the background, almost ignored by them, something is
       on the television.  The news.

                           NEWSCASTER (O.S.)
                 Preparations are nearly completed for
                 the upcoming anniversary gala
                 celebrating the formation of the
                 United Nations.  With nearly every
                 invitation confirmed, the occasion
                 promises to be the largest single
                 gathering of world leaders in history.

       The image in the screen is a helicopter shot of ELLIS
       ISLAND, with Liberty Island and the famous Statue in the
       background.

                           NEWSCASTER (contÃ­d)
                 Ellis Island, once an arrival point
                 for thousands of immigrants crossing
                 the Atlantic with the hopes of a
                 better life, will open its doors
                 again.  Only this time it will be to
                 leaders and their families from over
                 200 nations.

       Blob belches his skepticism deafeningly.

       TRACK FURTHER THROUGH THE LAIR AND OUT THE DOOR as the
       Newscast drones on.

       INT. CORRIDOR/OFFICE - NIGHT

       WE MOVE through subterranean corridors and past dozens of
       projects that share some similarity to the machine we
       have seen, including crude designs that have been
       rejected or stripped of their good ideas.

       FAINTLY we become aware of a clicking sound.  Almost like
       a stopwatch very far away, always growing louder.

       The newscast has faded and another voice is getting
       closer from somewhere down the hall.

       Sabretooth emerges around a corner heading towards us,
       turning just as we get to him.  The clicking is loud and
       clear now.

       Sabretooth enters an office and we follow him.  Seated at
       a desk in the center of the room is MAX LENSHERR - age -
       somewhere after sixty, but strong and vital for his
       years.  He is more often called MAGNETO.

       The clicking is from the sound of an executive pendulum
       thingy on his desk.  The six steel balls hang onto one
       another from string supports in formation depending on
       how many are let to fly from either end.  One ball
       strikes one and one ball swings out from the other.  Two
       balls and two, and so on.

       Slight difference.  There are no strings supporting the
       balls, thus defying gravity.

       A chess set - all of its pieces made of beautifully
       crafted iron - sits on the far end of the desk.

       He is watching television, or more accurately listening -
       his eyes looking off into space, deep in thought.

                           INTERVIEWER
                 ...and the leading voice in the call
                 for Mutant registration is Senator
                 Scott Frank Kelly, of Florida, who
                 claims to support the constitutional
                 rights of the genetically enhanced,
                 but whose crusade to register mutants
                 is gaining popularity.

       Now Kelly is on the screen.  Magneto shakes his head.

                           MAGNETO
                 Not this one again.

       When Sabretooth clears his throat, the clicking balls
       instantly freeze and hover there.

       The volume on the television drops, though no remote is
       in sight.

       Magneto notices SabretoothÃ­s apparent exhaustion, his
       torn clothing, including the slashes in his side.  His
       look asks Ã¬what happened?Ã®

       Sabretooth crosses the room and places the shining dog
       tag on the table.  The one he ripped from LoganÃ­s neck.
       He sits at the desk, puzzling over it.

                           MAGNETO (contÃ­d)
                 Your expression tells me the news is
                 not good, brother.

                           SABRETOOTH
                 I lost him.

                           MAGNETO
                 How?

                           SABRETOOTH
                 It was XavierÃ­s people.  They knew.

       Frustrated.  Magneto inspects the dog tag.

                           MAGNETO
                 I want him.  That is all they know
                 because that is all you know.

       Nothing odd about the tag at a glance, military dog tag,
       weathered and beaten, but certainly plain, Canadian
       Military, LoganÃ­s name, rank, and a faded serial number.

       His thumb feels the indention of the word at the bottom
       of the tag that does not seem to fit here.

       WOLVERINE

       We hear the voice of Senator Kelly on the TV.  Kelly is
       on the screen giving good face.

       As he turns up the television, and again, we donÃ­t see
       how, he places the dog tag on his desk, thinking.

                           KELLY
                 I think the PresidentÃ­s pre-occupation
                 with international affairs has drawn
                 his attention away from this problem.
                 AmericanÃ­s deserve the right to decide
                 whether they want their children to be
                 in school with mutants.  To be taught
                 by mutants.  They also have the right
                 to know the dangers.  ThatÃ­s the
                 purpose of registration.  And mark my
                 words, if the President isnÃ­t strong
                 enough to do what needs to be done...

       As the Senator continues we PULL BACK and see Magneto
       watching this.  He begins speaking over KellyÃ­s diatribe.

                           MAGNETO
                 And you may mark my words, Senator
                 Kelly.  All your plotting, all your
                 hatred.  I have plans for you.  IÃ­ve
                 seen you come, and I will see you go.

       As Magneto turns LoganÃ­s dog tag between his fingers, we
       canÃ­t help but notice FADED PURPLE SERIAL NUMBERS
       TATTOOED IN HIS ARM.
       He then drops the dog tag on the desk, Magneto stands and
       heads for the door, Sabretooth follows.  The television
       shuts off and Magneto waves a hand as though beckoning
       someone to follow.  Or some thing.

       He stops and looks back at the dog tag on the desk and
       waves again.  A paper clip just next to the dog tag skips
       off the desk and into MagnetoÃ­s hand.  He drops it,
       annoyed and tries again.

       A slight rattle, then nothing more, as though the dog tag
       were held down by an unimaginable weight.

       He walks over and picks up the dog tag, inspecting it,
       then trying to bend it.  Nothing.

                           MAGNETO (contÃ­d)
                 Can it be..?

       He puts it back on the desk.  Now Magneto concentrates -
       sending a wave of magnetic force that ripples the air
       around it.

       The tag trembles, but does not budge.  He looks at
       Sabretooth and smiles.

                           SABRETOOTH
                 Is that what youÃ­re looking for?

                           MAGNETO
                 A piece.  Only a piece.

                           SABRETOOTH
                 Is it enough?

                           MAGNETO
                 Enough for a test.

       And as Magneto looks up at Kelly on the television we:

       PAN OVER TO A BULLETIN BOARD on the wall beside him.

       To a periodic table, smaller than the first.

       But still with that red square and added letter Ã¬AÃ®.

       EXT. WHITE HOUSE - PARKING LOT - DAY

       Kelly and Guyrich walk out of the White House on their
       way to their limousine.

                           KELLY
                 I canÃ­t believe the President canÃ­t
                 see it.  I wouldnÃ­t be surprised if he
                 has a mutant on his staff.

       Kelly and Guyrich climb into the limo and slump back in
       their seats.

       INT. LIMOUSINE - DAY

                           GUYRICH
                 Have you thought of a demonstration of
                 some kind?  Maybe use the UN Summit to
                 our advantage.  The whole world will
                 be watching.

                           KELLY
                 IÃ­m not interested in the whole world,
                 Henry... IÃ­m interested in America.
                 Let the rest of the world deal with
                 mutants their own way.

                           GUYRICH
                 Where to?

       Kelly rubs his eyes.

                           KELLY
                 Home.

       Guyrich leans to address the driver.

                           GUYRICH
                 Dulles Airport.

       INT. LABORATORY - DAY

       Medical monitors beep, keeping track of the vital signs
       of -- Logan, who lies in a bed in the middle of a medical
       lab.

       In the wall beside LoganÃ­s bed is a light board on which
       hang LoganÃ­s X-rays.  LoganÃ­s skeleton seems to be more
       the creation of a Deco architect than of nature.
       Streamlined, refined... almost manufactured.

       He is asleep, recovering.

       Jean Grey enters the lab.  She walks over and examines
       the X-rays, fascinated by their unique structure.  She
       notices what appears to be an unusually complex network
       of bones in the forearm.  Jean looks down and runs her
       fingers over the traces of three incisions on the backs
       of LoganÃ­s hands.  JeanÃ­s eye moves across his body.  His
       rippling muscles.

       Jean uncaps an IV needle and moves to the middle of
       LoganÃ­s arm.  We cannot help but notice a diamond ring on
       her left hand.

       Jean starts to put an IV in LoganÃ­s arm.

       Just as she is sticking the needle in his arm HE JOLTS
       VIOLENTLY.

       SNAP

       LoganÃ­s hand reaches up quickly, breaking the needle off
       in his arm.  He grabs a startled Jean by the throat.

       He is out of bed.  She is unable to speak, choked silent
       by his grip.

       He places his fist near her face.  We see the three faint
       scars just above his knuckles.

       Hesitation.  Logan looks at her for a moment.  Taken by
       her beauty.  Then he is on his feet.

       Jean is on the floor, gasping for breath.

       Logan realizes something is missing.  He reaches to his
       chest and feels for the dog tag.  Gone.  He stifles a
       curse.

                           LOGAN
                 Where is it?

       He looks at Jean who recoils from him in terror.  Logan
       thinks, then bolts.

       INT. HALLWAY - DAY

       Logan comes out into an empty hall.  Strange.  Deathly
       quiet.  It is very sparse and modern, matching the lab we
       have just left.  Logan runs and goes through the first
       door he comes to, to keep Jean from seeing where he has
       gone.

       INT. READY ROOM - DAY

       He looks around and sees he is in some sort of locker
       room.  A row of lockers run along one side of the wall.
       And hanging from the other side in a row, are UNIFORMS,
       much like the ones Cyclops and Storm were wearing in the
       snow.

       He starts to rummage through the lockers, coming up with
       a shirt and pants that almost fit.  A pair of sneakers as
       well.

       He hears the sound of approaching foot-steps coming from
       the hallway.  He spots another entrance on the far side
       of the room and, carrying his clothes, he staggers out,
       still in considerable pain.

       INT. HANGER - DAY

       Logan rushes through the door, looking behind to see if
       he has been seen.  He closes the door and leans back to
       catch his breath... which stops momentarily as he looks
       around the massive hanger he has entered.

       The X-Jet, the stealth plane we saw in Alaska, now sits
       parked and quiet.

       Logan walks to the plane and stops -- listening.  We hear
       a strange THUMPING.  He listens for a second.  The sound
       picks up in speed and we realize that we are listening to
       the SOUNDS OF A BASKETBALL GAME coming from above.

       As Logan tries to digest this, the door that he had just
       come through begins to open, letting in a shaft of light.
       Logan looks around wildly for a moment, looking for a
       place to hide when -

       BING.

       An elevator door opens in the wall of the hanger ten feet
       from where Logan now stands.  He whips around and runs
       for it.

       There is a button marked Ã¬G.Ã®  He presses it.

       INT. HALLWAY - DAY

       The elevator opens on a hallway that doesnÃ­t match the
       rooms we have already seen at all.  It is plush and
       stately, the hallway of a great mansion.

       He hears a voice coming from a room.

       As he gets closer to it, we can begin to hear:

                           VOICE
                 ... until the Emperor Constantine
                 converted to Christianity.  With that
                 one act, history was changed.  The
                 Christians who were once prosecuted
                 and fed to the lions, became accepted.

       Now the voice is clear as a bell, coming from a room with
       the door slightly ajar.

       INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

       Logan peeks in and sees in front of a chalk board, a
       massive blue furry creature called BEAST.  Besides two
       arms and two legs, the only remotely human thing on his
       ape-like face is a pair of wire spectacles.  He addresses
       a class of kids between the ages of 16 and 17.
       Besides the occasional physical alterations, there is an
       overall oddness to the group, giving way to the fact that
       in some way or another these are all mutants.

                           BEAST
                 So as their leaders went, so did
                 follow the hearts and minds of the
                 people of the Roman empire.  Which
                 made for some very happy Christians.

       Now he sees Logan standing in the door, looking back at
       him in mute shock.

                           BEAST (contÃ­d)
                 Can I help you?

       All the students turn to see Logan, standing in a
       hospital gown with a mean case of bed head.  They start
       to giggle.

       Logan turns and heads down the hallway to the left.

       INT. HALLWAY - DAY

       Logan hears footsteps and quickly does a one eighty back
       down the hallway.  He turns a corner, hugging the wall.
       He halts.  A large oak door stands down the hall.  He
       smells something, taking in a deep breath, his head
       cocking to the side - listening.

       He turns and looks behind him.  More foot steps.  Someone
       is about to enter the hall.

       He turns again, ready to run the other way when he sees
       the SHADOWS of two more people coming from the other
       direction.  Logan is trapped.  He lunges for the large
       oak door and bursts through.

       INT. XAVIERÃ­S OFFICE - DAY

       Logan shuts the door and leans his head back against it,
       exhausted.

                           VOICE (O.S.)
                 Good morning, Logan.

       Logan, still clutching his stolen clothes, opens his eyes
       and sees a man sitting behind a large mahogany desk --
       PROFESSOR CHARLES XAVIER, an intense and intelligent man
       just to look at him.

                           XAVIER
                 Would you like some breakfast?

       Logan, who was prepared for anything but this, just
       stares.

                           XAVIER (contÃ­d)
                 IÃ­m sorry, allow me to formally
                 introduce myself -- I am Professor
                 Charles Xavier.  This is my school.

                           LOGAN
                 How do you know my name?

       Xavier taps the side of his head with his finger.

                           XAVIER
                 YouÃ­re not the only one with gifts.

       When he speaks, his lips do not move.  We realize Logan
       Ã¬hearsÃ® the voice in his head.  In addition, the voice is
       accompanied by the FAMILIAR SOUND OF FOOT STEPS
       indicating that perhaps Xavier had herded Logan through
       the mansion with his mind.  He does not like it.

       Xavier comes out from behind his desk.  We see that he is
       in a MOTORED WHEELCHAIR.  Realizing that he is safe for
       the moment, Logan begins putting on his stolen clothes.

                           LOGAN
                 What am I doing here?

                           XAVIER
                 I brought you here so that you would
                 be safe from Magneto.

                           LOGAN
                 Who?

                           XAVIER
                 A very powerful mutant who for some
                 reason has taken an interest in you.
                 IÃ­m not sure why, but until we find
                 out, I must ask you to stay.

       Logan looks Xavier over.  He is obviously a kind man who
       is offering his help.  Logan is silent for a moment.

                           LOGAN
                 No thanks.

       Logan goes to the door.

       Xavier, disappointed, just watches him go.

       INT. FRONT HALL - DAY

       Logan sees a grand entrance with two huge oak doors and
       brightly-polished steel knobs that scream Ã¬exit.Ã®  He
       starts in that direction when the doors begin to open.

       A moment of traffic, laughing, chatter... then they are
       all gone.

       He gets to the doors and pushes them open.  Bright white
       sunlight floods in, nearly blinding him.

       EXT. MANSION - DAY

       The first thing he sees through the haze is wings - GIANT
       WHITE, FEATHERY ANGEL WINGS.

       A young boy, no more than fourteen, has them sprouting
       from his back.  He is stretching not only his limbs, but
       his unusual appendages in the morning breeze.

       Sensing something - the boy turns, and sees this
       shambling ruin of a man in the doorway.

       Off LoganÃ­s expression, we hear the flapping of wings and
       see his awestruck face following the boy onto the sky.

       This only holds his attention for a moment.  Logan looks
       across an expanse of grounds that house the Mansion.  A
       high, wrought-iron gate surrounds the entire property.

       He watches as several children play basketball across a
       large court.

       Logan shakes his head and is out the closing door.

       Xavier simply watches from his window.

       EXT. MANSION - FRONT GATE - DAY

       Logan heads for the gate.

       SHOOK -- Logan pops his claws.

       Suddenly, the gate slowly opens -- Inviting him to leave.
       He pauses, momentarily confused.  He takes one long look
       back at the mansion.  And then leaves.

       Stay for a moment.  Watch him go.  Then pan across a sign
       which reads --

           PROFESSOR CHARLES XAVIERÃ­S SCHOOL FOR THE GIFTED

                        Westchester N.Y.

       PANNING slowly across the road to the thick woods on the
       other side of the street.

       SOMETHING MOVES in the trees, catching our eye.  Someone
       is watching.  It is Toad, camouflaged amidst the trees
       and branches.

       EXT. SKY - DUSK

       A helicopter streaks across the sky.

       INT. HELICOPTER - DUSK

       Kelly sleeps fitfully in the large seat.  A bump of
       turbulence.  He wakes suddenly and looks out the window
       seeing the ocean below.

       Kelly looks out the window again and sees water.  They
       are flying low.

       He looks at Guyrich, who sleeps as well.  He wakes him.

                           KELLY
                 Where the hell are we?

       Guyrich looks out the window and looks at Kelly, puzzled.
       He stands and goes to the door to the cabin of the
       helicopter.

                           GUYRICH
                 Pilot?

       No answer.  Guyrich tries to open the door.  ItÃ­s locked.

                           GUYRICH (contÃ­d)
                 Pilot?

       Kelly looks out the window now and sees the helicopter is
       closing in on an island - where, is anyoneÃ­s guess.  What
       is known is that the place is no pleasure resort.

       It is in fact some sort of refurbished island fortress,
       complete with turrets, built right into the side of the
       cliffs.

       EXT. ISLAND HELIPAD - DUSK

       A clearing in the middle of a ring of trees at the base
       of a rocky rise.  The helicopter touches down.

       THE PILOT, wrapped from head to toe in a flight suit and
       helmet, gets out and opens the side door, exposing Kelly
       and Guyrich to the intense wind of the rotors.  They
       cover their eyes, cowering.

       KELLYÃ­S P.O.V.

       Two figures come out of a hole in the mountain.  One
       seems extremely larger than the other.

       Guyrich and Kelly step out.  As they get closer he can
       make out Magneto and Sabretooth.

                           KELLY
                 Dear God... Dear... God.

       The Pilot removes his helmet to REVEAL:

       Pyro, smiling.

                           KELLY (contÃ­d)
                 What the hell is this?

       Kelly is utterly confused.  As Magneto nears, Guyrich
       steps forward to greet him, putting arms around MagnetoÃ­s
       neck and kissing him deeply.  Then Magneto looks deep and
       lovingly into GuyrichÃ­s eyes.

       And with that GUY SHAPE SHIFTS into a beautiful woman who
       herefore will be known as MYSTIQUE.  Her body is covered
       in iridescent blue scales, which complement her lovely,
       solid yellow eyes.

       Kelly, of course, is shocked.  Mystique shows a little
       hip, raising the scales at her mid-section mockingly, as
       the last of what we thought was Guyrich slips underneath.

                           KELLY
                 You... wha... Who are you... Where is
                 Henry?

                           MAGNETO
                 Mr. Guyrich has been dead for some
                 time Senator.

                           KELLY
                 You mutant bastards...

       Pyro grabs the Senator as he runs back for the helicopter
       in vain.

                           KELLY
                 Whatever you do to me... no matter
                 what youÃ­ll make me right.  Every word
                 I have spoken will be confirmed.

                           MAGNETO
                 Gosh, I hope so.

       As Kelly struggles against all hope.

                           KELLY
                 People like you are the reason people
                 like me exist.

       And with that, Mystique walks up.

                           MYSTIQUE
                 And people like you are the reason I
                 was afraid to go to school as a child.

       With that, Mystique punches Kelly.  Knocking him out
       cold.

       BLACK

       INT. MACHINE ROOM - MAGNETOÃ­S LAIR - NIGHT

       Kelly comes to.

       Magneto walks past him, holding LoganÃ­s dog tag.

       His thumb crushes one last time over the curious
       Ã¬Wolverine.Ã®

       PULL OUT TO REVEAL:

       Kelly is strapped to a metal chair, bound impossibly
       tight.  He struggles.  Mystique watches from the far side
       of the room.

                           MAGNETO
                 Are you a Ã¬God-fearing man,Ã® Senator?

       KellyÃ­s reaction tells him he is certainly afraid of
       something right now.

                           MAGNETO (contÃ­d)
                 That term always confused me.  As if
                 there were something to fear.

       Kelly looks around wildly, terrified.

                           MAGNETO (contÃ­d)
                 God after all, is often defined as all-
                 forgiving.  A description I rather
                 like.  I think what you really are
                 afraid of...

       Magneto uses his mind to move KellyÃ­s chair a little
       closer.  Kelly nearly loses it.

                           MAGNETO (contÃ­d)
                 ...Is me and my kind.  The Brotherhood
                 of Mutants.

       He touches KellyÃ­s face and Kelly recoils.

                           MAGNETO (contÃ­d)
                 And this law.  Your mutant
                 registration act is only the
                 beginning.

                           KELLY
                 The intention of registration act -

                           MAGNETO
                 INTENTION?  Intention, Senator?  We
                 are talking about mankind here.  His
                 fear.  It is only a matter of time
                 before mutants will be herded into
                 camps.  Studied for weaknesses.  And
                 eventually wiped off the face of the
                 Earth.

       Kelly shakes his head.  There is nothing he can say to
       sway this man.

       Magneto turns and admires his machine.

                           MAGNETO (contÃ­d)
                 Well, weÃ­re much more giving than
                 that.  We simply want to share with
                 you... To help you understand.

                           KELLY
                 What is it you intend to do to me?

                           MAGNETO
                     (smiling)
                 LetÃ­s just say, God works too slowly.

       Magneto moves to the machine.

                           MAGNETO (contÃ­d)
                 YouÃ­re a leader, Senator Kelly -- you
                 set an example.  And if more of you...
                 were like more of us?  Well, youÃ­ll
                 see.

       Kelly watches as Magneto takes LoganÃ­s dog tag and places
       it atop a tube at the bottom of a large spire in the
       center of the room some thirty feet high.

       He walks toward the opposite side of the room and watches
       as the tag is raised to the top of the device, through
       the shaft.

                           MAGNETO (contÃ­d)
                 DonÃ­t fear God, Senator.  And
                 certainly - most certainly... donÃ­t
                 fear me.

       A beat.

                           MAGNETO (contÃ­d)
                 Not any more.

       ANGLE ON:

       MAGNETO raises his arms and a series of metal rings up
       from the machine platform that holds the dog tag.  With a
       slight motion of his hand, the rings begin to spin slowly
       gaining in speed as Magneto controls it with his power.

       The air around it ripples, gaining in intensity.

       WAVES OF MAGNETIC ENERGY POURS from MagnetoÃ­s hands
       toward the machine.

       Now, Magneto has the rings spinning around the dog tag at
       such speed, the rings themselves are no longer visible -
       merely a blur around the stationary tag.  Magneto lowers
       his hands.  The machine is now working on its own.

       KellyÃ­s eyes grow wide with fear as the metal dog tag
       begins to glow.  Dull at first... the brightly... too
       brightly.

       The deafening whine of the machine builds louder and
       louder.

       Suddenly -- SILENCE

       FIVE SECONDS OF ABSOLUTE SILENCE.

       The sphere vanishes, enveloped in a light so white, it
       defies description.

       But IÃ­ll try:

       A light that seems to ooze rather than radiate.  A light
       that fills the room as it expands outward and engulfs
       everything in sight.

       It is liquid light.  Creeping and unstoppable.

       From outside the room, Pyro and Sabretooth watch through
       the window.  It comes through, first casting its shadows
       darkly against the wall, then erasing them as it swallows
       them -  as though they were never there.

       INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

       From under a door, the light leaks in, filling the room.

       All through the lair, air vents, keyholes, drainpipes and
       the like, the liquid light fills the lair to the gills.

       EXT. MAGNETOÃ­S LAIR - NIGHT

       THROUGH THE TURRET ATOP THE LAIR, the light beams up into
       the night sky, shinning like a beacon for miles.

       Then the white light obscures all.  Fueled by this tiny
       piece of metal, the light extends like an ever growing
       bubble, out and up over the ocean.

       PULL BACK FROM THE SMALL ISLAND

       The bubble of white light is easily five miles across.

       INT. MACHINE ROOM - NIGHT

       Kelly grits his teeth, barely visible in the whiteness.

       Then it is gone.  He hangs his head in exhaustion.

       Magneto himself is a bit overwhelmed.  He looks at his
       own skin - no apparent change.  He shakes his head,
       blinks his eyes.

       Sabretooth and Pyro are also a bit struck by the display
       and they also seem a bit dazed.

       Magneto walks over and reaches into the still steaming
       metal device.  His hand comes out holding the dog tag -
       actually its remains.

       A frazzled, blackened wire, warped and spent.  Nothing
       more.  And this turns to dust in his fingers.

       Magneto has amazed even himself this time.

       The silence is shattered by a phone ringing.  Sabretooth
       picks it up.  He listens, then hands the phone to
       Magneto.

                           SABRETOOTH
                 WeÃ­ve found him.

       Magneto puts the phone to his ear.  He smiles.

                           MAGNETO
                 Where?

       ANGLE on Kelly, his skin glistening slightly, almost
       luminescent.  Pinker (healthier?) then it was when he
       came in.

                           KELLY
                 Oh... Oh God... what have you done to
                 me?

       Magneto hangs up the phone.  He crosses to Kelly, leans
       in and whispers in his ear.

                           MAGNETO
                 Welcome to the future... brother.

       Magneto stands, looks at his machine, then back at Kelly.

                           MAGNETO (contÃ­d)
                 Now if youÃ­ll excuse me...  I have a
                 train to catch.

       EXT. TRAIN - NIGHT

       The silver Amtrack moves speedily through the dark
       countryside.

       INT. TRAIN - NIGHT

       A CONDUCTOR makes his way through a half filled car of
       commuters taking tickets.  He passes a restroom and exits
       the car.  He takes a seat.

       Logan emerges from the restroom, having avoided paying
       his fare.

       A few seats in front of him, in a grouping of seats that
       face one another, sit four large guys, early twenties --
       TheyÃ­re the guys from your college named Brad that used
       to get drunk and try to drown freshmen in the toilets.
       WeÃ­ll call them BRADS 1, 2, 3, and 4.  They are drinking
       from beer cans in paper bags.

       Across the aisle from them sits a lone oddly pretty
       twenty year old girl.  Her name is ROGUE -- a dark-eyed
       and somewhat distant creature.  From the shawl around her
       head to her boots, layers of odd clothing wrap every inch
       of her body, except her face and hands.  She looks worn,
       it is the face of a runaway.  Next to her, a dirty duffle
       bag.

       The Brads are staring at Rogue, making lewd comments
       about her.  They have obviously been drinking for awhile.

                           BRAD 1
                 Hey.

       Rogue looks at him, then quickly looks away.

                           BRAD 1 (contÃ­d)
                 Hey... Hey IÃ­m talking to you.

       The Brads laugh amongst themselves at her reaction.

                           BRAD 2
                     (looking at her duffle bag)
                 Where are you going?

                           BRAD 1
                 Awww... look guys sheÃ­s shy.

                           BRAD 3
                 Maybe thatÃ­s why sheÃ­s alone.  Is that
                 why youÃ­re alone?

       Brad 4, who is closest to Rogue, leans toward her.

                           BRAD 4
                 IÃ­ll keep you company.

       Rogue is silent and turns her back on him, trying to
       ignore him.

                           BRAD 4 (contÃ­d)
                 Hey...  IÃ­m talking to you.

       Rogue continues to ignore him.  This gets Brad 4 angry.
       The other Brads watch his failure and laugh.

                           BRAD 4 (contÃ­d)
                     (louder)
                 I said IÃ­m talking to you!

       ANGLE ON: Logan, his ears picking up everything.

       Rogue looks down trying not to look at them.

       Brad 4 will not be ignored.  He reaches out to the one
       place which is not covered by clothing that he can reach -
       - RogueÃ­s hand lying at her side.

                           BRAD 4 (contÃ­d)
                     (louder still)
                 I said...!

       He grabs her hand.

       Suddenly, Brad 4Ã­s eyes open wide as if heÃ­s in shock, an
       instant later, he COLLAPSES.

       Rogue reels back.

       BradÃ­s 1, 2, and 3 stand up, they are angry.

                           BRAD 1
                 Hey, what did you do?

                           ROGUE
                 DonÃ­t touch me.

       Rogue stands, frightened and confused.  Brad blocks her
       in.

                           BRAD 3
                 Hey Brad, sheÃ­s a mutant!

       Rogue moves to get away, but Brad 1 shoves Rogue.  Rogue
       falls to the floor of the train, right next to LoganÃ­s
       feet.  Brad 1 moves toward her.

       Suddenly, Logan steps in front of Brad 1.

                           LOGAN
                 How about you sit down and leave the
                 kid alone, alright?

                           BRAD 1
                 SheÃ­s a mutant.

                           LOGAN
                 Yeah, well, nobodyÃ­s perfect.

       ANGLE ON: Rogue, she gets up and huddles toward the rear
       of the train.

                           BRAD 1
                     (who is considerably larger
                      than Logan)
                 I think you should take a seat little
                 fella.

       He shoves Logan backward.  Logan gathers himself.  Brad 4
       is very weak but regaining consciousness.

       Brads 2 and 3 stand to back their friend against Logan.
       ItÃ­s now three against one.  All the passengers are
       watching --

                           LOGAN
                 Listen -- I donÃ­t want any trouble.

                           BRAD 1
                 Well you got trouble.

       Brad 1 slams his fist into LoganÃ­s stomach.  Logan grabs
       the manÃ­s fist and lifts him up and over, slamming him
       into the train floor.

       Brad 2 grabs a commuterÃ­s briefcase and smashes it on
       LoganÃ­s head.  Bursting open, its contents fly
       everywhere.

       Logan turns.  Brad 2 stares wide-eyed as the gash on
       LoganÃ­s head starts to heal.

       Suddenly, Brad 1 is up.  He grabs Logan around the neck
       from behind.  He holds Logan in his head lock while Brad
       2 and 3 start punching  him in the stomach and face.
       Logan is taking quite a beating and naturally the entire
       train of people are doing nothing.

       ANGLE ON: LoganÃ­s eyes, his pupils are getting smaller.
       His brow furrows like a wolf.  A low guttural GROWL.

       Suddenly rage -- PRIMAL RAGE

       LoganÃ­s feet kick out, his left foot strikes Brad 1 in
       the face knocking him backward, while his right foot
       hooks around Brad 2Ã­s head dragging him forward.  With
       his left hand Logan grabs Brad 2 by the throat, squeezing
       the esophagus.

       Brad 2 is paralyzed.  His eyes roll up as the oxygen is
       cut off.  Brad 2 collapses.

       ANGLE ON: Brad 3 running out of the car with the other
       passengers.  A TRANSIT COP pushes past the fleeing
       passengers, into the car.

       Brad 1 still bear hugs Logan from behind.  Logan reaches
       pushing his knuckles against Brad 1Ã­s leg.  Suddenly:

       SHOOK -- the sound of metal extending.  Brad 1 howls in
       pain.  SHOOK -- the sound of metal retracting.

       Brad 1 releases Logan and stares down at three punctured
       holes in his leg.  Logan wheels around, kicks him to the
       floor, and punches him.

       All eyes in the train are on Logan, as he raises his
       fist.

       SHOOK -- Logan extends his claws.

       Logan is at the peak of his rage.  The passengers stare
       in disbelief.  Even Rogue is astonished.

                           TRANSIT COP
                 Freeze... transit police.  Drop your
                 weapon.

       Logan pauses, only for a second.  Brad 1 is wailing for
       his life.

       But rage has taken over.  Logan raises his blades to
       finish what he started.

       Suddenly, THE TRAIN LURCHES VIOLENTLY.  Logan goes flying
       backward.

       EXT. TRAIN - NIGHT

       The train has been brought to a sudden stop -- but the
       wheels are still turning.  Finally, they are shut down.

       INT. TRAIN CAR - NIGHT

       The lights are out.  Everyone gathers themselves.  Then
       comes a low grinding creak.  The sound of metal bending.
       Rivets popping.

       EXT. TRAIN - NIGHT

       Like the top of a sardine can, the entire side wall of
       the train car is peeled off.  Revealing the terrified
       passengers inside -- and Magneto, Sabretooth, Mystique
       Toad and Pyro on the outside.  With a final thrust, the
       air RIPPLES and Magneto tosses the car wall to the side.

       Passengers from the other cars stare wide-eyed out their
       windows.  The train has stopped at a railroad crossing,
       the gates are down.

                           MAGNETO
                 You can come out now, Logan.  YouÃ­re
                 among friends.

       The transit cop rises to his feet, brandishing his
       pistol.

                           TRANSIT COP
                 Freeze!

       With a turn of his finger, Magneto draws the pistol to
       him.  The cop holds tight and is yanked off the train,
       onto the ground.  With another twist of his hand, Magneto
       makes the gun leap from the copÃ­s grasp and HOVER,
       pointing at the copÃ­s head.

                           MAGNETO
                 You Homo Sapiens and your guns.

       The gun cocks.

                           XAVIER (O.S.)
                 ThatÃ­s enough, Max!

       All turn to see Xavier, seated in his wheelchair --
       flanked by Cyclops, Jean and Storm.  All, save Xavier,
       are in uniform.

       THUNDER RUMBLES ACROSS THE SKY

       ANGLE ON: Storm, a GUST OF WIND.

                           MAGNETO
                 IÃ­ll never understand your regard for
                 them, Charles.

                           XAVIER
                 And IÃ­ll never understand terrorists.

                           MAGNETO
                 I am trying to save our kind, Charles.
                 You should do the same.

                           XAVIER
                 Not at the cost of lives, Max.

       XavierÃ­s metal chair is gripped by magnetic forces.  It
       shakes and begins to inch towards Magneto.

                           MAGNETO
                 Magneto.

       The chair is pulled closer to Magneto.  Cyclops steps
       forward.  Xavier need not turn to know help is coming.

       Magneto sees and respects CyclopsÃ­s power.  The chair
       stops moving.

                           XAVIER
                     (to Cyclops)
                 ItÃ­s alright... itÃ­s alright.

       Magneto glances at Storm, then Cyclops.

                           MAGNETO
                 The two in Alaska.  Just how do you
                 people manage to be in the right place
                 at the right time?  Still tinkering
                 with Cerebro?

                           XAVIER
                     (referring to Logan)
                 What do you want with him?

       Magneto smiles now, tapping his METAL HELMET.

                           MAGNETO
                 CanÃ­t read my mind?

       XavierÃ­s expression falters.  It appears as if the helmet
       has been made to block Xavier from doing just that.

                           MAGNETO (contÃ­d)
                 IÃ­ll tell you something, Charles, we
                 are more alike now than we were when
                 we started.

                           XAVIER
                 Is that so?

                           MAGNETO
                 Still trying to make the world safe
                 for our kind.  Still trying to find a
                 way to introduce ourselves --
                 definitively.

                           XAVIER
                 You definition of definitive was
                 always a bit extreme for me, Max.
                 What is it like these days?

                           MAGNETO
                 LetÃ­s just say that I am out to make
                 some radical changes.  Now come on
                 Charles.  For old times sake, for your
                 sake...  Leave him to me.

       Logan slowly rises from the huddled passengers.
       Sabretooth fighting the urge to move on him.  Logan
       glares back at Sabretooth.

                           MAGNETO (contÃ­d)
                 Ahh... there you are brother.  I
                 believe you possess something I am
                 very much in need of.

       Just then, SABRETOOTH ROARS UNCONTROLLABLY and punches
       Toad in the stomach, doubling him over.  Oddly - Toad is
       laughing.  He stands upright.

                           TOAD
                 Do it again.

       Another roar and another punch.  Toad is crying and
       laughing at the same time.

                           TOAD (contÃ­d)
                 Oh God it hurts.  Do it again.

       Magneto watches this, momentarily stunned.

       Suddenly, Pyro grabs hold of his face.

                           PYRO
                 IÃ­M BLIND.

       And Mystique MORPHS into a small child and begins tugging
       at MagnetoÃ­s pant leg.

                           MYSTIQUE
                 I have to go to the bathroom.

       Magneto looks at the cause of it all: XAVIER, HIS EYES
       CONCENTRATING, HAS ALL OF MAGNETOÃ­S MINIONS UNDER HIS
       PSYCHIC CONTROL.

       Cyclops cannot help laughing.  Storm and Jean smile.

       Magneto is furious.

                           MAGNETO
                 If I could make you understand.  If
                 you could just be made to see it the
                 way I do.  The way itÃ­s going to be.

                           XAVIER
                 The way what is going to be?

                           MAGNETO
                 IÃ­m going to change the world with or
                 without you as a witness, Charles.
                     (Points to Logan)
                 And this one gets a front row seat.

                           XAVIER
                 What do you mean to do?

       And Magneto steps back a little further.  His oddly
       behaving consorts follow.

                           MAGNETO
                 This checkmate goes to you.  I didnÃ­t
                 want to hurt anyone.  But you leave me
                 no choice.

                           XAVIER
                 WHAT DO YOU MEAN TO DO?

       Sabretooth and Toad walk away, still with the punching
       and asking to be punched.

       Magneto takes the little girl/Mystique by the hand and
       the blind Pyro by the arm and leads them away,
       humiliated, to their waiting helicopter.

       Xavier turns back to Logan, still standing in the train
       car, amidst all the huddled passengers.  Suddenly, all
       the passengers except Rogue lay on the floor and seats
       and go to sleep.  A few of them even snore.

                           XAVIER (contÃ­d)
                 Now will you come back with us?

       A look crosses LoganÃ­s face.  Uncomfortable.

                           LOGAN
                 Look, I appreciate your concern.  But,
                 I do better on my own.

       Xavier indicates the wreckage of the train.

                           XAVIER
                 You got less than sixty miles today.
                 IÃ­ll make you a deal.  Two days.
                 If we havenÃ­t figured out what Magneto
                 wants with you by then...  IÃ­ll bring
                 you back myself.

       Logan looks up at Xavier suspiciously, hating that he is
       making sense.  Xavier moves closer.

       Logan looks over at Rogue, covered in her layers of
       clothes.  Storm is helping her off the train, yet taking
       care not to touch her skin.

                           LOGAN
                 What are you going to do with her?

       Xavier looks to Rogue.  A warmth comes over his face.  An
       look of understanding.  At a glance he has read her mind.
       He knows her pain -- her struggle.  Rogue looks to
       Xavier.  Their eyes meet.

                           XAVIER
                 Rogue is a beautiful girl, with an
                 extraordinary power.  One that even
                 her own family isnÃ­t able to accept.
                 SheÃ­s been on her own for weeks now,
                 searching for a home.  A place to
                 belong.

       Xavier turns to Logan.

                           XAVIER (contÃ­d)
                 -- WeÃ­re going to give her that.

       Logan looks at rogue, contemplating this.  Then to
       Xavier.

                           LOGAN
                 Forty-eight hours, old man.  But if
                 you cross me, I wonÃ­t feel any guilt
                 about what I do to you.

                           XAVIER
                 Deal.

       Logan eyes the rest of the gang until he settles his gaze
       on Jean.  He offers a faint seductive smile.  This is not
       lost on Cyclops.

       INT. MAGNETOÃ­S LAIR - CELL - LATER - NIGHT

       A cell with bars, but no visible door.

       Kelly is hunched over his toilet, heaving.  His suit is
       rumpled and dirty, showing signs that time has passed.

       There is a television just outside the door:

       We see SEVERAL NEWS HELICOPTERS circling a platform built
       against the backdrop of the main entrance to Ellis
       Island.  We see massive security measures, the likes of
       which have never been attempted, being prepared.

       (Voice plays over the rest of the scene)

                           NEWSCASTER (V.O.)
                 Is there such a thing as too much
                 security?  A possible complication
                 adding to the United Nations
                 Anniversary is the sheer number of
                 security personnel for what will be
                 the largest single summit in the
                 history of the planet.

       He walks towards the cell and tries to look down the
       hall, pressing his face to the bars.

                           NEWSCASTER (V.O. CONTÃ­D)
                 While the Secret Service has never had
                 difficulty handling one or even
                 several world leaders, it has never
                 had to handle the daunting task of
                 watching over all of them.

       It is only then that he hears a slight crack and his head
       squeezes between the bars like a soft-shelled egg.  He
       gasps in pain, but more from shock.  He pulls his head
       back with some difficulty and POP, it squeezes right back
       through.

                           KELLY
                 What have you bastards done to me?

       Kelly is horrified.  Disgusted.  He paces the cell,
       unable to comprehend what has happened to himself.

       It is only when he hears the sound of a HELICOPTER IN THE
       DISTANCE that he reacts.  He starts to panic, then
       collects himself.  Then he goes over to the bars again.
       He pauses, afraid... then:

       He pops his head through again.  He turns his shoulder
       toward the bars and begins to push.  His feet slip in the
       floor and his fingers stretch and crack inside, then his
       ribs begin to pop one by one with the brittleness of
       undercooked spaghetti.  It is agonizing, but Kelly
       finally manages to pull his horribly-altered body through
       the bars.

       INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

       KellyÃ­s whole chest and pelvis are slightly flattened
       beneath his clothes, but with a hideous crunching sound,
       they seem to inflate again back to normal.

       Kelly looks at his body with a mixture of fascination and
       disgust.

                           VOICE
                 HEY.

       Kelly turns and screams.  Blob has just walked into the
       room and lunges, grabbing him by the arms.  Kelly is
       enveloped in this fat, hulking mass.  He manages to keep
       one hand free and all he can do is push it against BlobÃ­s
       face.  It is futile.  Until...

       Steam begins to come off BlobÃ­s face.  And Blob SCREAMS
       IN PAIN.

       EXT. HELIPAD - NIGHT

       Senator KellyÃ­s helicopter, which has obviously been
       pilfered for MagnetoÃ­s use, lands.

       Magneto, Sabretooth, Pyro, Mystique (no Toad) all climb
       out, having returned from their ill-fated attempt to get
       Logan.

       INT. HALLWAY - ELSEWHERE - NIGHT

       Kelly peers down the hall where we first went on our way
       to meet Magneto.

       Kelly, with only that way to go, does so, passing once
       again the odd assortment of machines, very reminiscent of
       the one he was exposed to.

       He hears voices coming toward him and he looks around
       wildly, wondering what to do.  Shadows foretell the
       arrival of the brotherhood headed this way.

       Kelly turns to run back from where he cam from.

       INT. HALLWAY - ELSEWHERE - NIGHT

       Magneto and Sabretooth come walking from the other end of
       the hall and pass the very spot where we just saw Kelly.
       No sign of him.

       INT. CELL - NIGHT

       From which Kelly has escaped.  The bars bend to make room
       for Magneto as he walks into the room.

                           MAGNETO
                 How are we feeling today, Senator?
                 Advanced, I hope...

       But he freezes when he actually enters the room.

       First, he sees that Blob is laying on the floor with a
       purple, welt-like hand print across his face.  It is
       blistered and hideous.  Blob is gasping for air.

       Magneto looks and sees the cell is empty.  He looks at
       Sabretooth.

                           MAGNETO (contÃ­d)
                 I want him alive.

                           SABRETOOTH
                 IÃ­ll find him.

                           MAGNETO
                 ALIVE.

       And Sabretooth bolts back from where they came.

       EXT. MAGNETOÃ­S LAIR - NIGHT

       Kelly hits the fresh air, looking around wildly.  He runs
       for the edge of a cliff high over the ocean.

       He raises his hands, we see his palms are covered with
       those wicked spines and they are dripping a venomous
       fluid not too different in color from the wound on BlobÃ­s
       face.

       But then suddenly, something is wrong.  Kelly buckles,
       clutching his stomach again.  He squelches what would
       have been a scream of agony.

       He looks at his palms and the spikes are gone.

       Kelly hears footsteps.  Suddenly out of the darkness
       Sabretooth barrels toward him.

       Kelly turns and LEAPS.  Sabretooth comes to the edge of
       the cliff.

       When he looks over, KellyÃ­s body has vanished.  Swallowed
       by the sea.

       Only his clothes remain on the rocks below.

       INT. LOGANÃ­S ROOM - NIGHT

       Jean shows Logan the simple dorm cube with a bed and a
       small desk.  Jean opens the door for Logan and he
       inspects the sparse surroundings grimly.  Cyclops stands
       just outside the door - eavesdropping.

                           JEAN
                 Anything else I can get you?

                           LOGAN
                 Some cigars.  Case of beer.

                           JEAN
                 ThereÃ­s no smoking or drinking on the
                 school grounds.

                           LOGAN
                 I wonÃ­t light the cigars - how about
                 that?

                           JEAN
                 IÃ­ll see what I can do -- You should
                 get some sleep.  Even with your
                 healing ability, youÃ­re going to be
                 hurting for a while.

                           LOGAN
                 What if I like the pain?

       Jean doesnÃ­t know what to make of that.  She is about to
       leave, then pauses.

                           JEAN
                 The Professor said you were a solider.
                 Actually, I believe he used the word
                 mercenary.

                           LOGAN
                 Yeah?  Well I donÃ­t like to talk about
                 my past.

                           JEAN
                 Maybe, the Professor could help you
                 with that.

                           LOGAN
                 By reading my thoughts?

                           JEAN
                 If necessary.

                           LOGAN
                     (smirks)
                 What if theyÃ­re naughty?

       Jean smiles politely at his knowing glance.

                           JEAN
                 Get some shut-eye, slick.

       She shuts the door.

       INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

       Jean hesitates at the door, thinking.  Smiling.  She
       turns and only then does she realize Cyclops is standing
       there.

       She is startled.

                           JEAN
                 Scott.. I -

                           CYCLOPS
                 I donÃ­t like him being here.

                           JEAN
                 What are you talking about?

                           CYCLOPS
                 You saw what happened tonight.  You
                 think Magneto wonÃ­t come after him
                 again.  You think he wonÃ­t come here
                 if necessary.  This is a school, for
                 GodÃ­s sake.

                           JEAN
                 If Magneto is planning to use Logan
                 for some terrible purpose itÃ­s our
                 responsibility to do something.

       Cyclops shakes his head.

                           JEAN (contÃ­d)
                 WhatÃ­s wrong?  ThereÃ­s something else
                 bothering you.

       Cyclops gets closer to Jean.  She puts her hand on his
       chest.

                           CYCLOPS
                 I have a bad feeling about this.

       Jean leans in slowly and kisses Cyclops just beside his
       mouth

                           JEAN
                 You know I love you, Scott.

       Cyclops pulls her close.  The hold each other.

       INT.  LOGANÃ­S ROOM - NIGHT

       E.C.U. LoganÃ­s ear.  His super-sensitive hearing has
       picked up the whole conversation.

       Logan looks over on the bed and sees a new sketchbook and
       several pencils.

       A small note is attached.


       					I hope you donÃ­t mind.  I understand this
       					helps you relax.

                                       - X

       Logan shakes his head.

       INT.  XAVIERÃ­S OFFICE - LATER - NIGHT

       A white light board.  BeastÃ­s blue furry hand slides a
       long, full-body x-ray in place.

       Beast is showing LoganÃ­s x-rays to Cyclops, Storm, Jean
       and Xavier.

                           BEAST
                 Adamantium.  Until today I thought it
                 to be a myth.  Impenetrable,
                 unbendable, resistant to the most
                 extreme heat, cold, indestructible.

       Beast points to the x-ray.

                           BEAST (CONT'D)
                 ItÃ­s been grafted to his entire
                 skeleton.

                           XAVIER
                 He also has accelerated healing
                 abilities - uncharted regenerative
                 capability, making his age impossible
                 to determine.  He could very well be
                 older than I am.

                           STORM
                 Is the Adamantium part of his
                 mutation?

                           XAVIER
                 No.  Someone put it there, relying on
                 his healing abilities to keep him
                 alive.

                           CYCLOPS
                 What do you think Magneto wants with
                 him?

       Xavier wheels himself to the window, starring out, deep
       in thought.

                           XAVIER
                 IÃ­m not entirely sure itÃ­s Ã¬himÃ® that
                 Magneto wants.

       ANGLE ON: X-ray of LoganÃ­s Adamantium skeleton.

       INT. MANSION - NIGHT

       Rogue.  The waifish young thing who hides so well in the
       shadows seems more comfortable to be moving through the
       mansion at night.

       She passes through the halls and rooms not making a sound
       in her strangely-swathed body suit.

       INT. LOGANÃ­S ROOM - NIGHT

       She creaks a door open slowly, letting a shaft of dim
       light slice the darkness.

       The light shines across a nightstand.  Rogue stares down
       at the notepad, a sketch it.  It is of an animal, small
       but fierce - a wolverine.

       She walks in to a figure laying in the bed and stands
       over him.  Over Logan.

       He lays under a single sheet, sweating, his eyes moving
       quickly this way and that in R.E.M.  His hands twitch.

       Rogue leans closer.

       PUSH IN ON LOGANÃ­S EYES AS THEY MOVE UNDER THE LIDS.

       FLASH - DREAM SEQUENCE

       INT. MILITARY LAB - THE PAST - NIGHT

       Like none we have ever seen thus far.  In fact, judging
       by most of the instruments here, we are looking at a
       laboratory some fifty years old.

       Logan looks down and we can see his body, naked, strapped
       to a table.

       A hand puts a mask over his mouth and -

       BLACK

       He awakens -

       STILL LOGANÃ­S P.O.V.

       He struggles weakly with restraints as doctors in lab
       coats and thick, red rubber gloves stand over him taking
       notes, paying very little attention to him at all.

       On the other side of the room is a huge vat filled with
       some kind of molten metal.
       At the base of the vat is a giant electromagnet
       generating a huge gyroscope which created enormous
       friction energy - the apparent source of the intense heat
       for melting the metal in the vat.

       AGAIN THE MASK PUTS HIM UNDER AND:

       BLACK

       Awake again, but this time sinking into water -
       restrained completely now.

       Logan looks down and gets only a glance of his body,
       seeing that he is a series of incisions from head to toe -
       literally split open - the flesh held back with hundreds
       of clamps.

       HE SINKS INTO THE STRANGE LIQUID - LIKE WATER BUT THICK
       AND VISCOUS.

       And the sound of a DROWNING SCREAM.

       AND THE METAL IS POURED IN AFTER HIM.

       THE SOUND OF MOLTEN METAL HITTING LIQUID IS UNNERVING.
       Mixed with screams, it is unbearable.

       INT. LOGANÃ­S ROOM - NIGHT

       SCREAMING

       LoganÃ­s screaming as he comes to.

       LoganÃ­s eyes FLASH OPEN.  He looks up and sees a figure
       looming over him.  In a flash he reacts.

       THUD.  Nothing more.  Then silence.

       The door bursts open and Cyclops stands in the doorway
       shocked.  Frozen.  Jean is next and finally Storm.  They
       can only stare.

       Logan sits upright in bed, CLAWS EXTENDED, INTO ROGUEÃ­S
       CHEST.  She is literally frozen at the end of his arm.

       Finally, Cyclops breaks the silence and moves to grab
       her.

                           STORM
                 DONÃ­T TOUCH HER.

       Cyclops freezes.

       Logan finally pulls his claws free and retracts them.
       Rogue staggers, she pitches forward and touches his face
       gently with her hands, as though she would like him to be
       the last thing she sees on this Earth.

       Logan and Rogue, locked in a fatal moment of tenderness
       snaring a look of loneliness that only they can
       understand.

       But suddenly, Logan seems to change.

       And before he can say another word, he begins to tremble,
       then he starts to howl in pain.

       Rogue SNAPS BACK, mouth open in a gaping, silent scream.
       What sound comes out does not match the expression at
       all.  Merely a gasp, like steam escaping.  Through the
       huge slash in her clothes, we see the wound on her chest
       slowly vanish.

       Before long, she transforms back into a healthy young
       girl with no sign of injury.

       Then, her escaping breath begins to accelerate, much in
       the way LoganÃ­s did - too much like LoganÃ­s did.  It is
       as if she has taken in his trait of berserker rage.  Soon
       she is smashing things all around her.  One hand rakes
       the wallpaper like claws.

       Finally, she gets a hold of herself, becoming the
       introverted Rogue we all know so well.

       Then she stands slowly, looks at the others.

       And she runs from the room.  Storm runs after her.

       The rest turn to Logan, who lays on the floor,
       convulsing.

       Jean goes to help him.  She looks back at Cyclops.  His
       expression makes it clear that his worst fears about
       Logan have come to pass.

       EXT. PUBLIC BEACH - DAY

       A familiar scene of suburban escapism.  Crowded enough
       that most people can move about unnoticed.

       In fact, most people do not notice the very large
       jellyfish shooting through the water at remarkable speed.
       And only a few notice the COMPLETELY TRANSPARENT MAN
       emerging from the water.

       It is Senator Kelly, and he resembles in many ways a
       jellyfish.  His skin and innards are clear and gooey.  It
       is only when he comes completely and naked out of the
       water that he returns to somewhat normal.

       He walks up to the beach and people recoil from the very
       sight of him.  Pointing, whispering.  Then just laughing
       at the naked man.

       Kelly grabs a towel off an empty chair, a Hawaiian shirt
       off another.

       Suddenly, he buckles, grabbing his stomach and lurching
       away in terrible pain.

       He barely pauses when he hears a childÃ­s voice in semi-
       whisper:

                           CHILDÃ­S VOICE
                 Mom, is that a mutant?

       INT. HALLWAY - DUSK

       Storm and Logan walk down the hall.  Logan is wearing
       sweats.  He has obviously just woken up.  The sun is low
       in the horizon and the hall is suffused with an orange
       glow.

       Students pass by them.  By now, the students have heard
       rumors about what happened the night before.  They watch
       Logan fearfully as they pass by him.

                           LOGAN
                 Why is everybody up at sunrise?

                           STORM
                 The sun is setting, Logan.  YouÃ­ve
                 been asleep for nineteen hours.

                           LOGAN
                 What did she do to me?

                           STORM
                 She borrowed your power to save her
                 life.  When she touches someone, she
                 absorbs their strengths -- their
                 gifts.  In your case -- your ability
                 to heal.  ThatÃ­s why she keeps her
                 body covered.

                           LOGAN
                 I felt like she almost killed me.

                           STORM
                 If she held on any longer she could
                 have.

                           LOGAN
                 And you think it helps calling her
                 Rogue?

       Storm shakes her head, but remains patient.

                           STORM
                 WeÃ­ve learned to embrace what we are
                 rather than hide it like an
                 affliction.  For some, it has become
                 their identity.  You mock the names
                 these people choose but they wear them
                 as badges of pride.

       They arrive at the door to the gym.

                           LOGAN
                 Inspiring -- Now what am I doing here?

                           CYCLOPS (O.S.)
                 I wanted to talk to you.

       Logan turns and sees Cyclops.

                           CYCLOPS (contÃ­d)
                 Storm, would you excuse us please?

                           STORM
                 Of course.

       She exits.

                           CYCLOPS
                 LetÃ­s take a walk.

       Cyclops begins to walk away in the other direction.

       Logan just watches him go.  After a moment, he decides it
       might be more interesting to see where this is going.  He
       follows.  They walk across the hall to:

       INT. GYMNASIUM - NIGHT

       On first glance, the gym looks really average.  A fairly
       standard boxing ring in the middle.  A fairly standard
       weight set nearby.

       Then you notice the weights themselves are abnormally
       large.

       100.  200.  300.  400 pounds.  All the way up to 2000.
       And that is just one stack.

       Cyclops enters first with Logan coming in behind him.

                           CYCLOPS
                 How long have you been in Alaska?

                           LOGAN
                 I donÃ­t remember.  Is that what you
                 wanted to ask me?

       Logan is barely through the door when Cyclops whips
       around on Logan and thumps his finger into his chest.

                           CYCLOPS
                 I just wanted to make you clear on
                 something.  Personally, I donÃ­t care
                 what Magneto wants with you.  He can
                 take those claws of yours and use them
                 for Barbecue skewers.  What I do care
                 about is the safety of this group.
                 The Professor is in charge, and after
                 the Professor, thereÃ­s me.  So, for
                 the remainder of your time here,
                 youÃ­re going to keep that killer
                 instinct of yours locked down so no
                 one else gets hurt.

       Beat.

                           LOGAN
                     (smirks)
                 IÃ­ve served with men like you before.
                 Methodical.  Systematic -- Naive.  You
                 know what happens to those men in a
                 real fight?

                           CYCLOPS
                 You know, you --

                           LOGAN
                 Shut up.  I got no interest in you,
                 Xavier,
                     (he points mockingly at the
                      XÃ­s on CyclopsÃ­ uniform)
                 or your... X-Men.

       Logan takes him in for a moment.

                           LOGAN (contÃ­d)
                 And I donÃ­t think this has anything to
                 do with my Ã¬killer instinct.Ã®  You
                 just donÃ­t like the way IÃ­m looking at
                 your girl -- Or maybe you donÃ­t like
                 the way sheÃ­s looking back.  And maybe
                 you think youÃ­re man enough to do
                 something about it.

       Cyclops is enraged.  A red light begins to glow around
       the edge of his visor and the ruby-quartz lens brightens.
       We can faintly hear the low hum of immense power that is
       now barely contained.  Before Cyclops can even react,
       Logan puts his fist against CyclopsÃ­ throat.  SHOOK!
       Logan extends one claw up one side of CyclopsÃ­ neck.  He
       smiles.

                           LOGAN (contÃ­d)
                 CÃ­mon sport.  You think you can blow
                 the meat off my bones before I gut
                 you?  LetÃ­s find out.

       The air is now charged with tension.  The two men are
       about to attack when-

                           XAVIER (O.S.)
                 Cyclops!

       Logan whirls and sees Xavier regarding them sternly.
       Logan turns his building anger on Xavier.

                           LOGAN
                 I have a question for you, Chuck.
                 WhatÃ­s the point?

       Xavier sits calmly as Logan, claws still extended,
       marches over to him.

                           XAVIER
                 The point of what?

                           LOGAN
                 This.  This whole God damn thing.
                     (derisively, at Cyclops)
                 Making yourselves into some sort of
                 Ã¬teamÃ® of super-powered freaks.
                 Teaching wayward mutants about
                 classical literature.  For what?

       Logan continues to advance on Xavier.  Cyclops moves to
       stop Logan, but Xavier waves him off.

                           XAVIER
                 The point is to step into a more
                 evolved position of social
                 responsibility.  To recognize that
                 there is a world out there and that we
                 mutants are as much a part of it as
                 normal human beings.

                           LOGAN
                 What if it never happens?  What if
                 theyÃ­re so afraid of us that we become
                 the enemy? -- This place is gonna be
                 one giant cemetery.

       Xavier has heard this argument before.

                           XAVIER
                 Now thatÃ­s Magneto talking.

                           LOGAN
                 No.  ThatÃ­s me talking.  And you know
                 what?  ItÃ­s only been thirty-two hours
                 and you still have no idea what this
                 guy wants with me.

                           XAVIER
                 I believe he wants you for your
                 Adamantium.

       Logan raises his hand to his chest grasping for something
       that no longer hangs from his neck.

                           XAVIER (contÃ­d)
                 YouÃ­re thinking of your dog tag.  It
                 was made of Adamantium wasnÃ­t it?

                           JEAN (O.S.)
                 Professor.

       Logan turns and sees Jean walking towards them.

                           XAVIER
                 What is it?

                           JEAN
                 RogueÃ­s missing.

       Logan looks at Jean with concern.

       INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT

       A long, dark subterranean corridor with gleaming walls
       and floor.  Well lit and strangely echoless.

       Logan follows Xavier, who are in turn followed by Storm,
       Cyclops and Jean to a thick steel door at the end of the
       hall.

                           LOGAN
                 Where are we going?

                           XAVIER
                 To find Rogue.

                           LOGAN
                 How?

                           XAVIER
                 The brainwaves of mutants are quite
                 different than those of the average
                 human being.

       At XavierÃ­s eye level is a black screen with a chin-rest
       like you see at the eye doctor.  Xavier rests his head in
       it and the screen lights up.

                           XAVIER (contÃ­d)
                 Cerebro amplifies my power.  It allows
                 me to browse the worldÃ­s consciousness
                 and find the genetically enhanced.

       A vertical beam scans across his eye and a picture of
       XavierÃ­s retina appears on the screen next to a
       computerized image of the same.  The two images overlap
       and match perfectly.

                           XAVIER (contÃ­d)
                 This is how I found you.

       A small beep and a loud KNOCK of tumblers rolling and the
       vault door opens.

       They walk inside.

       INT. CEREBRO - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

       They come into a room with a high sphered ceiling -
       entirely black.

       In the center of the room is a huge - for lack of a
       better term - device.  Part computer, part super-
       structure, it is the sort of precision tangle of metal
       and wire that would make Da Vinci weep.  It has a space
       in the bottom that seems to fit Xavier and his chair
       perfectly.  Suspended above its center -- a web of wires,
       tubes, and cables all connecting to the heart of the
       device -- a CHROME SKULLCAP.

       Logan slowly circles the device.

       Logan looks at Xavier, perhaps even a little impressed.

                           LOGAN
                 You designed this yourself?

                           XAVIER
                 Actually, Magneto helped me put it
                 together.

                           LOGAN
                 He helped you?

                           XAVIER
                 We were friends once...  But that was
                 a long time ago.

       Jean, Logan, Cyclops and Storm watch as Xavier fits his
       wheelchair into the huge machine, and the chrome skull
       cap lowers onto the ProfessorÃ­s head, fitting like a
       second skin.  It comes to life.  What was dark and
       menacing is now a brilliant explosion of colored lights.

       CLOSE UP ON:

       XAVIER - into and through his eyes and:

       EXT. SPACE - NIGHT

       Closing in rapidly on the planet Earth.

       Passing into its atmosphere, making a few orbits, all the
       while hearing the deafening voices of billions.

       Every country, every city, every town, berg, hamlet and
       village.

       Every language.

       Every thought.

       The voices descend to a sizeable crowd of millions, then
       thousands, gradually working their way to one.

       EXT. SKY - OVER WESTCHESTER - NIGHT

       Down a tree-lined road and around a corner into a parking
       lot.

       Single out a figure that - by the clothes - can only be
       Rogue.  Close in faster and faster, lower and lower until
       we go right through the back of her head to:

       BLACK

       SILENCE

                           ROGUE (O.S.)
                 I donÃ­t belong...  I donÃ­t belong...
                 IÃ­m sorry... so sorry... thereÃ­s
                 nowhere...

       INT. CEREBRO - NIGHT

       XavierÃ­s eyes open.

                           XAVIER
                 IÃ­ve found her, Westchester Mall.

                           LOGAN
                 IÃ­ll go.

                           CYCLOPS
                 No...  IÃ­ll go.

       Logan looks over to Jean.

                           LOGAN
                 O.K. sport... you go.

       INT. WESTCHESTER MALL - NIGHT

       A mother and child wander in a typical shopping daze.

       PULL OUT TO REVEAL

       Crowds of shoppers mill about, a typical crowded evening
       at the mall.  Rogue comes up the escalator, wandering
       through them all.

       She walks under a high-sphered glass ceiling, revealing
       the night sky outside.

       She walks over to a VictoriaÃ­s Secret store and looks up
       at the mannequins in the windows who wear almost nothing
       at all.  Quite a contrast from her own, stifling garb.
       She touches the glass as though trying to reach them,
       then she moves on.

       ROGUEÃ­S P.O.V.

       She looks all around the mall at the many oblivious
       people here.  Children playing tag on one side.  A young
       couple holding hands.

       Human contact all around.

       She walks past a small child, her hand nearly brushing
       the girlÃ­s hair.

       Rogue takes a seat on a bench, alone.

       A figure comes into frame.

                           STORM
                 Rogue.

       Rogue looks up and sees Storm standing right in front of
       her.  Her eyes dart around, looking for a way out.

                           STORM (contÃ­d)
                 You donÃ­t have to run.

       Finally, Rogue surrenders.

                           ROGUE
                 IÃ­m sorry.  IÃ­m not like the rest of
                 you -- IÃ­m tired of hurting people.

       She starts to cry now.

                           STORM
                 ItÃ­s okay.

                           ROGUE
                 Why did I have to be like this?  What
                 purpose does it serve?

       And when Rogue looks up, she sees another figure - this
       one filling the frame behind Storm.

       A huge clawed hand grabs Storm around the throat and
       lifts her up as she struggles in vain.

       INT. MALL - LOWER LEVEL - NIGHT

       Cyclops looks up and sees Storm is being CHOKED BY
       SABRETOOTH, her feet not touching the ground.

       Rogue is frozen with fear.

       He tries to get a shot with his visor, but too many
       people are in the way.

       INT. MALL - UPPER LEVEL - NIGHT

       Sabretooth smiles as Storm struggles to turn.  He
       whispers in her ear.

                           SABRETOOTH
                 Scream for me.

       CLOSE UP ON:

       STORMÃ­S EYES as the life is being squeezed out of her.

       INT. XAVIERÃ­S OFFICE - NIGHT

       MIRROR SHOT OF XAVIERÃ­S EYES

       Suddenly, Xavier touches his throat, then raises a
       shaking hand to his head.

                           XAVIER
                 Dear God.

       Xavier wheels himself from the room.

       INT. MALL - LOWER LEVEL - NIGHT

       Cyclops has a clear shot now.  His eyes start to glow
       brightly.

       Suddenly, a familiar movement on the pedestal behind him.
       Toad has been camouflaged the entire time.  He comes down
       and FLICKS HIS LIZARD-LIKE TONGUE, snatching the visor
       from CyclopsÃ­ face.

       Deep red light far greater than anything we have ever
       seen before comes blasting out of cyclopsÃ­ eyes without
       any sort of control, as if a fire hydrant had been ripped
       from the ground.

       His head comes back and the light blows the whole of the
       glass ceiling to smithereens, bringing it down on
       panicking shoppers who scatter.

       Toad leaps to the second level and then again out of
       sight.

       INT. MALL - UPPER LEVEL - NIGHT

       Sabretooth reacts, surprised by the sudden shift.  This
       gives Storm one last chance to breath.

       We notice now that something is happening to her body.

       INT. MALL - LOWER LEVEL - NIGHT

       Cyclops stumbles helpless, his eyes are shut to prevent
       further destruction.

                           CYCLOPS
                 GET OUT OF THE WAY.  GET OUT OF THE
                 WAY.

       INT. MALL - UPPER LEVEL - NIGHT

       Storm, nearly lifeless now, struggles with what little
       strength she has to get free of Sabretooth.  He relishes
       the slow kill.

       But suddenly ALL THE HAIR ON HIS BODY STANDS ON END.
       Sabretooth is momentarily confused.

       StormÃ­s eyes open wide as her body convulses.

       BOOM

       A huge bolt of lightning shoot from her body into
       SabretoothÃ­s chest, knocking him back in shock.  Storm
       falls to the ground, not breathing.

       Sabretooth, stunned and scorched, gets to his feet and
       smiles at his handiwork.  He is about to move in and
       finish them both when the rumble of a helicopter can be
       heard above.

       He looks up and sees SENATOR KELLYÃ­S HELICOPTER passing
       over the hold in the roof.  Sabretooth leaps up and pulls
       himself out of the opening.

       Toad is a leap behind.

       Rogue rushes to Storm, struggling with how to give her
       mouth to mouth, CPR, anything to resuscitate her without
       touching.  She is starting to panic now.  She looks
       around, but anyone still left in the mall is running for
       the doors.

                           ROGUE
                 SOMEONE HELP ME.  SHEÃ­S NOT BREATHING.

       INT. MALL - LOWER LEVEL - NIGHT

       Cyclops stumbles blind and helpless, covering his eyes.
       He hears Rogue screaming.

                           CYCLOPS
                 ROGUE?

                           ROGUE (O.S.)
                 HELP ME.  STORM ISNÃ­T BREATHING.

       Cyclops tries to find a way up, but he trips over all the
       debris, helpless.

                           CYCLOPS
                 YOU HAVE TO COME AND GET ME.  I CANÃ­T
                 SEE.

       EXT. STREETS - NIGHT

       Xavier is in a specially designed car that enables him to
       drive solely with his hands.  He races towards the mall.

       INT. MALL - UPPER LEVEL - NIGHT

       Rogue is talking, walking backwards towards Storm, trying
       her best not to lay a hand on Cyclops.

                           ROGUE
                 Here, here, here... a little left.
                 Careful.

       ANGLE ON:

       Cyclops drops to his knees, the sprinklers still gushing.
       His eyes are tightly shut.

       He feels for StormÃ­s face and touches her lips.

                           CYCLOPS
                 Oh God.

       He immediately begins mouth to mouth, though it may have
       been too long.

       EXT. MALL - NIGHT

       Xavier fights the rush of traffic - people fleeing madly
       from the mall.

       As he pulls up to the front doors, he sees Cyclops
       emerging, carrying Storm.  She is conscious, but her
       breathing is shallow.  His eyes are shut tightly and he
       must follow RogueÃ­s direction.

       Sirens wail in the distance.

       Xavier looks at the lot of them: waifish Rogue, blind
       Cyclops, unconscious Storm and his wheelchair-bound self
       as their guardian.

                           XAVIER
                 But why would they do this?

       Then a look of realization...

       EXT. MANSION - MEANWHILE - NIGHT

       Rogue hurries past several students.

       She runs up to the large front doors of the school, but
       they are locked.  She looks around and then runs toward
       the side of the building.

       INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT

       Beast, continuing his research into MagnetoÃ­s plan, is
       analyzing the x-rays of LoganÃ­s skeleton.  Several books
       about metallurgy are scattered across the table.

       INT. LOGANÃ­S ROOM - NIGHT

       Logan is sketching quietly.  He chews a cigar, keeping it
       politely unlit.

       He hears something.  He stands, goes to the door and
       opens it.  He cocks his head... listening... smiling...

       We hear it too, sharing his ears.

       It is a woman breathing, groaning.  He smiles and follows
       the noise.

       EXT. MANSION - NIGHT

       Rogue climbs through a studentÃ­s open window.

       INT. MANSION - NIGHT

       She darts down a hallway and around a corner, looking
       around, staying low.

       INT. GYMNASIUM - NIGHT

       Jean is working out on an average-sized set of free-
       weights, sweating, pushing hard.  Obviously the sound
       Logan heard.  She is on her back doing presses.

       Suddenly, she looks up and sees Logan standing over.  She
       is startled and starts to drop the bar.  He catches it.

                           LOGAN
                 You should always work with a spotter.

                           JEAN
                 HeÃ­s busy right now.

       Logan cannot help but glance at her left hand, still
       clinging to the bar.  The shimmering diamond on the third
       finger.

                           LOGAN
                 I was thinking maybe you and me could
                 go into town.

                           JEAN
                 Were you now?

                           LOGAN
                 What do you say?

                           JEAN
                 Not interested.

       Logan shrugs, starts to take his hands away.  Jean is not
       ready to take the weight of the bar.  It almost comes
       down on her when he catches it again.

                           JEAN
                 Let go.

                           LOGAN
                 Suit yourself.

       And he does.  And so does Jean at the same time.  She
       gets up and faces Logan - the bar simply hovers in mid-
       air.

       Logan smiles.

       INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT

       Beast looks at his watch.  ItÃ­s stopped.  He puts it to
       his ear -- shakes it.  Then his ears perk up.  He hears
       something.  He glances at the wall.  All things METAL --
       picture frames, chairs, objects on tables, etc. start to
       move one after the other.
       It is as if some magnetic force is moving past the wall,
       just outside the lab, heading for the open door.

       Beast, sensing the danger, makes a run for the metal
       door.  Just as he reaches it, it SLAMS closed -- knocking
       him back across the room.

       Beast CRASHES into the wall on the opposite side of the
       lab.  His leg badly hurt, Beast tries to crawl toward the
       door.

       But as he does this, METAL OBJECTS from around the lab
       fly in front of it sealing him in.

       INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT

       Rogue moves quietly down the corridor that leads to
       Cerebro.

       She comes to the retinal scanner - she brings her eye to
       the screen.

       It lights up and scans her eye.  A PICTURE OF XAVIERÃ­S
       RETINA appears on the screen.

       A SINGLE WORD APPEARS ON THE SCREEN beneath it:

       ACCESS DENIED

       The scanner scans again.

       E.C.U. ON ROGUEÃ­S EYE

       Something is wrong.  The eye not being scanned is a
       familiar yellow.  It is Mystique.

       Her other eye changes in the light of the scanner.  The
       retina reshaping itself in minute ways.

       ANGLE ON:  The screen -- ACCESS GRANTED -- CHARLES XAVIER

       The door to Cerebro opens.

       Rogue or rather Mystique, rushes in.  She goes to a small
       panel on the side of Cerebro.

       She opens it.  She reaches in.  SHE REMOVES A COMPUTER
       CHIP -- No more than three inches wide.

       INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

       ANGLE ON:  The black boots of a man, walk down a hallway,
       as students peer from their sleeping quarters, terrified.

       INT. GYMNASIUM - NIGHT

       Jean is casually wiping sweat from her brow.  LoganÃ­s
       eyes possess a certain focus intent.

                           LOGAN
                 HeÃ­s uptight.

                           JEAN
                 He takes his work seriously.

                           LOGAN
                 He takes himself seriously.

                           JEAN
                 What is it youÃ­re failing to get at?
                 Are you interested in me?

                           JEAN
                 IÃ­m just interested.

       Holding out her left hand.

                           JEAN
                 Logan, do you see this ring?

                           LOGAN
                 IÃ­ve seen a lot of rings.

                           JEAN
                 Yeah, IÃ­ll bet you have.

       Before he can reply, Rogue is standing in the doorway
       looking at them.

                           JEAN
                 Rogue, where have you been?

                           ROGUE
                 Logan.  The Professor wants you to
                 come with me right away.

       E.C.U. on LoganÃ­s nose.  His nostrils flare... sensing...

       Logan squints the tiniest bit.  We know he knows
       something is wrong, but he is hiding it.

                           LOGAN
                     (to Rogue)
                 Hey Rogue, tell Jean what you were
                 telling me last night.

       Rogue pauses.  Confused.

                           ROGUE
                 The Professor--

       Logan walks towards her.

                           LOGAN
                 You remember.  About women.

       He moves closer.

                           ROGUE
                 Logan--

                           LOGAN
                 Whatever you say about them being the
                 same...

       SHOOK.  The claws are out.  HE LUNGES.

                           LOGAN (contÃ­d)
                 No two women smell alike.

       He grabs Rogue by the throat.

                           JEAN
                 Logan, what are you doing?

       Jean, seeing Logan threaten Rogue with his claws for the
       second time, RAISES A VAULTING HORSE INTO THE AIR.

                           LOGAN
                 This ainÃ­t Rogue!

       He keeps his claws pointed at her face.

       ANGLE TIGHT: LoganÃ­s left hand is wrapped around RogueÃ­s
       throat but part of it is TOUCHING THE EXPOSED SKIN OF HER
       FACE WITH NO ILL EFFECTS.

       Jean realizes that Logan is right.  ROGUE MORPHS INTO
       MYSTIQUE.

                           MAGNETO (O.S.)
                 Telekinesis.

       Jean spins around and sees MAGNETO.  Without hesitation,
       the vaulting horse FLIES AT MAGNETO.

       Simultaneously, one of the thousand-pound weights flies
       from the weight set and smashes the vaulting horse aside.

                           MAGNETO (contÃ­d)
                 Fascinating.  What I wouldnÃ­t give for
                 that.  Alas, metal is all IÃ­m good
                 for.  But it seems to serve me well
                 enough.

       Jean is completely unaware of the huge set of lockers
       rising behind her.

                           LOGAN
                 Jean!

       WHAM.

       The lockers hit her in the back, sending her flying.

       Jean lies motionless on the floor, unconscious.  The
       heavy lockers are floating above her, wavering between a
       few feet and a few inches.

                           MAGNETO
                 I do love a good check mate.

                           LOGAN
                 What do you want?

                           MAGNETO
                 Come with me and IÃ­ll let her live.

                           LOGAN
                 You think I care about her?  IÃ­m the
                 only one whoÃ­s sure to walk out of
                 here.

       Pause.

                           MAGNETO
                 Then why donÃ­t you kill her.

       This catches Logan a little off guard.

                           MAGNETO (contÃ­d)
                 Go on.  Kill her.  You can do it
                 quicker than I will.  Maybe IÃ­ll just
                 cripple her.

       The lockers now stand upright, hovering over JeanÃ­s
       knees.

                           MAGNETO (contÃ­d)
                 So do her the favor.  Show her mercy.

       Logan thinks for a moment -- looks at Jean still
       unconscious on the floor.  Then:

       Logan retracts his claws.

       Mystique has morphed back into her natural state with the
       exception of ONE OF ROGUEÃ­S POCKETS, which still clings
       to her hip.  Mystique produces a large syringe from the
       pocket and sticks it in LoganÃ­s neck.  LoganÃ­s legs
       weaken instantly.

                           MAGNETO (contÃ­d)
                     (to Mystique)
                 Call the others and tell them we have
                 what we came for.

       EXT. MANSION - LATER - NIGHT

       The fence that surrounds the property has been bent and
       buckled violently.

       INT. MANSION HALLWAY - NIGHT

       Xavier wheels down the hallway, pajama clad students are
       milling about the halls.  Their faces showing that they
       are afraid to go back to their rooms.  One GIRL, younger
       and smaller than the others, seems particularly upset.

       Xavier wheels over to her and gently touches the side of
       her face.

                           XAVIER
                 ItÃ­s going to be alright.

       She manages a faint smile.  Then Xavier looks to the
       other students -- their frightened faces.

       INT. LABORATORY - LATER - NIGHT

       Beast reclines in his lab chair, a splint on his leg.

       Jean stands with Cyclops who watches through a new visor.

       Rogue sits off to the side, bearing the guilt.  While
       Storm, her neck badly bruised, stands near her.

       For the first time we have seen -- Charles Xavier is
       angry.

                           STORM
                 When Rogue left the mansion, they must
                 have followed her.

       Xavier shuts his eyes furious.

                           XAVIER
                 Yes... they wanted me out of the way.
                 If I had been here... I...

       Xavier opens his eyes and sees Rogue sitting on a chair
       in the corner.  She is visibly upset.  Xavier wheels over
       to Rogue.  Xavier reaches out and softly touches her
       clothing covered shoulder.

                           XAVIER (contÃ­d)
                 This was not your fault.  I knew there
                 was a danger, I should have never left
                 the school.

       And with that he turns his wheelchair to the door.

                           XAVIER (contÃ­d)
                 I am going to find Logan.

       Xavier leaves.

       INT. CEREBRO - NIGHT

       Xavier enters and wheels himself into the giant machine.
       It immediately comes to life - lighting the room.  The
       chrome skull cap descends onto XavierÃ­s head.

       Xavier closes his eyes as the machine powers up.

       E.C.U. ON XAVIERÃ­S EYES

       They fly open.  And then a terrible noise.  The sound of
       a well tuned machine suddenly going horribly wrong.
       Xavier is in terrible pain.

       His back arches and he falls from his chair onto the
       floor.  He struggles to reach for a fire alarm on the
       wall.  His fingers stretch until finally -- he pulls it.

       Warning bells wail.  Xavier falls unconscious,
       convulsing.

       ANGLE ON: Cyclops and Jean as they burst into the room.

       INT. LABORATORY - LATER - NIGHT

       Xavier lies asleep in a hospital bed.  Several electrodes
       are taped to his head.  A screen next to the bed monitors
       his erratic brain waves.

       Jean and the splinted Beast stare at the monitor
       following its rhythm.  Storm and Rogue stand at the foot
       of the bed.  They are each trying to hide their fear, and
       not doing a very good job of it.  Cyclops looks on, the
       stress shows on his face.

                           CYCLOPS
                 WhatÃ­s wrong with him?

                           JEAN
                 His vital signs are weak and getting
                 weaker.

                           BEAST
                 IÃ­m in the process of running more
                 tests.  But it seems that every minute
                 that goes by he gets weaker.

       All are silent.  Rogue looks to Beast with desperate
       eyes.

                           ROGUE
                 Can you help him?

                           BEAST
                 I donÃ­t know.

       Xavier lies in bed, motionless.

       INT. FRONT HALL - DAY

       Two huge wooden front doors -- morning light shines
       through the jagged holes in the wood where the knobs had
       been pulled off.  The antique steel knobs lay twisted and
       mangled on the floor.

       The small girl from last night kneels in front of the
       door with a dustpan, sweeping up the mess.

       Something catches her eye.  She sits up and leans in
       closer to the jagged hole in the door.

       ANGLE ON: The little girl -- light from the hole washes
       over her face.  Then suddenly the light is cut off, as if
       something is blocking the hole.

       DOLLY IN: as the small girl steps back, a look of
       fascination comes across her face.  As if she sees
       something coming through the hole.

       INT. CEREBRO - DAY

       Cyclops, Jean and Storm stand before the device.  Beast
       rises awkwardly on his splinted leg, his back to the open
       control panel.

                           BEAST
                 ItÃ­s gone.  The neuro-filter, someone
                 removed it.

       Jean stands.

                           STORM
                 What does that mean?

                           BEAST
                 The neuro-filter acts like a surge
                 protector, regulating the infinite
                 flow of information from Cerebro to
                 the ProfessorÃ­s mind.  ItÃ­s what keeps
                 him from being crushed by the
                 consciousness of millions.

       Cyclops steps away, pondering BeastÃ­s words.  He
       understands the ramifications -- the damage that has been
       done to Xavier.

                           CYCLOPS
                 Can the Professor repair his own mind?

                           BEAST
                 IÃ­m afraid without CerebroÃ­s help, he
                 wonÃ­t have the strength to heal
                 himself -- And without the neuro-
                 filter... thereÃ­s no Cerebro.

       Jean is noticeably upset.

                           JEAN
                 HeÃ­s already losing control of his
                 vitals.  Respiratory.  Cardiovascular.
                 Unless we manage to replace the filter
                 by tomorrow morning, IÃ­m afraid.

                           CYCLOPS
                 We have to find Magneto.

       He exits.  Jean follows him.

       INT. HALLWAY - DAY

       Cyclops is standing, motionless.

                           JEAN
                 Are you all right?

                           CYCLOPS
                 No.  IÃ­m...  I donÃ­t know if we can do
                 this without Charles.

       Jean puts her hand lovingly to his face.  Cyclops takes
       her hand.

                           JEAN
                 He put you in charge for a reason,
                 Scott.

       She goes to kiss him.

                           SMALL GIRL
                 Dr. Grey?...

       The small girl stands alone in the hallway.

                           SMALL GIRL (contÃ­d)
                 Someone is here to see you.

       JeanÃ­s eyes widen -- and around the corner steps Senator
       Kelly, wearing the clothing he had taken from the beach.
       He trembles as though from a high fever.  His body is
       covered with a layer of sweat.

                           KELLY
                 Dr. Grey.

                           JEAN
                 Senator?

                           CYCLOPS
                 How did you get in here?

                           KELLY
                 Your front door was damaged... there
                 was a hole...

       Kelly makes a hole with his hands that is not much larger
       then that of a coffee can.

                           KELLY (contÃ­d)
                 ... I squeezed through.

       Kelly buckles in pain, but then catches himself.

       Jean and Cyclops rush to help him.  Beast crutches
       himself out to see whatÃ­s happening.

       Kelly notices Beast.

                           KELLY (contÃ­d)
                 What in GodÃ­s name are you?

                           BEAST
                 IÃ­m Beast.

                           KELLY
                 Of course you are.

       INT. LABORATORY - LATER - DAY

       Xavier is in bed, eyes closed.

       Rogue holds vigil at his side.

       Kelly is in the bed next to him, trembling, burning up
       from what seems to be a bad fever that keeps getting
       worse.

       Jean has a syringe in her hand and is swabbing some
       alcohol on KellyÃ­s skin.

                           KELLY
                 IÃ­m sorry to come here, Ms. Grey.  I
                 was afraid if I went to a hospital,
                 they would...

                           JEAN
                     (interrupting)
                 Treat you like a mutant?  We are not
                 what you think.  Not all of us.

                           KELLY
                 Tell it to the ones that did this to
                 me.

       Jean looks closer at his hands.

                           JEAN
                 I donÃ­t see these spikes youÃ­re
                 talking about.  IÃ­m going to give you
                 an antibiotic for the - Oh my God.

       Jean and Kelly both look as the cotton swab ignites like
       flash paper in her hand.  Everyone is shocked.  Jean
       pauses and takes the bottle of alcohol from the shelf.
       She pours a small amount on KellyÃ­s arm and it instantly
       catches fire.

       INT. LABORATORY - LATER - DAY

       Rogue is still sitting in a chair, next to XavierÃ­s bed --
       XavierÃ­s opens his eyes.  He looks at Rogue and smiles
       softly.

                           XAVIER
                 Hello, Rogue?

       Rogue almost jumps out of her chair with excitement.

                           ROGUE
                 Hold on, IÃ­ll get the others.

       Rogue exits.  Xavier slowly looks over to Kelly lying in
       the bed next to him.  Both men are weak and getting
       weaker.

                           XAVIER
                 Senator... Kelly?

                           KELLY
                 Yes...  Who are you?

                           XAVIER
                 I am Charles Xavier.  This is my
                 school.

       Kelly tries to speak, but his strength is waning.

       The two men are a pitiful sight, both slowly coming
       apart.

                           XAVIER (contÃ­d)
                 Can you tell me what happened to you?

       Kelly is in pain.  ItÃ­s a struggle to speak.

                           KELLY
                     (weak, delirious)
                 I was kidnapped...  They killed
                 GUYRICH... mutants...  There was a
                 light... a bright... light.

       Xavier turns to Kelly, looking deep into his eyes.

       He begins to PROBE KELLYÃ­S MIND.

       INT. EXT. VARIOUS FLASHBACK - DAY/NIGHT

       FLASH

       The following is an audio-visual collage of KellyÃ­s
       perspective from throughout the film, coming back to us
       in a new order.

       THE CAGE OF SENATOR KELLY in MagnetoÃ­s lair.  NOW HIS
       P.O.V. as seen by Xavier.

       Vision fades in and out in a sedated haze.

       He is laid out of a gurney.

                           KELLY (V.O.)
                 Whatever you do to me... no matter
                 what -- youÃ­ll make me right.  Every
                 word I have spoken will be confirmed.

       He looks up and sees Mystique wheeling the gurney,
       smiling down at the Senator.

                           MYSTIQUE (V.O.)
                 And people like you are the reason I
                 was afraid to go to school as a child.

       FLASH

       Kelly is looking around a large, sphered room.  In the
       center is the MACHINE.

                           JEAN (V.O.)
                 The mutant gene tells the body when it
                 needs to change.

                           KELLY (V.O.)
                 I can assure you, there is no such
                 creature in my genes.

       FLASH

       The DOG TAG as it is elevated into the machine.

                           JEAN (V.O.)
                 In every organism on Earth there exits
                 a mutator gene -- The X-factor.  The
                 beginnings of another stage of
                 evolution.

       SLOWLY BUILDING LIGHT, growing brighter and brighter.

                           MAGNETO (V.O.)
                 God works too slowly.

       Pull back as if the camera is pulling back through his
       eye, into his head -- A MICROSCOPEÃ­S VIEW OF HIS CELLS,
       suddenly and violently disturbed.

                           KELLY (V.O.)
                 What have you bastards done to me?

                           CHILDÃ­S VOICE (V.O.)
                 Mom, is that a mutant?

       KellyÃ­s reflection in the metal of the sink in his
       prison.

                           MAGNETO (V.O.)
                 YouÃ­re a leader Senator Kelly, you set
                 an example...

       BlobÃ­s face, burned by KellyÃ­s hands.

       Over the cliff.

                           GUYRICH (V.O.)
                 ... A Demonstration of some kind?

       The venomous spike emerging from KellyÃ­s hands.

                           MAGNETO (V.O.)
                 Because if more of you... were like
                 more of us... like more of us...

                           GUYRICH (V.O.)
                 ... the UN summit... the whole world
                 will be watching.

                           KELLY (V.O.)
                 What is it you intend to do to me?

       The woman staring up at him on the beach.

                           KELLY (V.O.)
                 Oh...  Oh God... what have you done to
                 me?

       The boy on the beach.

       JARRING FLASH

                           KELLY (V.O.)
                 Dear God.... dear... God.

                           NEWSCASTER (V.O.)
                 ... the largest single summit in the
                 history of the planet.

                           JEAN (V.O.)
                 ... the mutator gene will activate.

                           MAGNETO (V.O.)
                 Welcome to the future... brother...
                 The brotherhood of mutants.

       A VIOLENT COLLISION OF NOISE, IMAGE AND LIGHT AND THEN:

       XavierÃ­s eyes burst open.

       INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT

       Rogue leads Storm, Jean, Beast and Cyclops quickly into
       the lab.

       Xavier is lying in his bed.  Jean looks up at the screen
       above him and sees XavierÃ­s brain waves have dropped
       severely.

       Kelly lies unconscious in his bed, his heart monitor
       weakening.

       Beast limps over to Xavier.  Xavier struggles to speak.
       Beast bends down so that Xavier can whisper into his ear.

       E.C.U. XavierÃ­s lips move as he tells Beast what he
       knows.

       INT. LAB - LATER - NIGHT

       Jean, Storm, Beast and Cyclops talk while the news plays
       silently on the TV in the background.

                           BEAST
                 It appears as though Magneto has built
                 a machine which somehow triggers the
                 mutator gene in normal human beings.
                 And he is using Adamantium as its
                 core.

                           CYCLOPS
                 Its core?

       Beast grabs a wax pen and draws a lightbulb on a glass
       drawing board.

                           BEAST
                 Thomas Edison knew how to make the
                 light bulb.  He had the energy source.
                 He had the vacuum.  But he didnÃ­t have
                 the filament.  He tried metal after
                 metal but nothing would hold to power.

                           STORM
                     (nods -- now understanding)
                 ... until he found tungsten.

       Beast finishes his lightbulb by drawing the filament.

                           BEAST
                 Correct...  Apparently, Adamantium is
                 the only metal strong enough to hold
                 the energy this machine produces.  He
                 used the Adamantium in LoganÃ­s dog tag
                 to test it on the Senator.  And I
                 assume now he plans to use the rest of
                 LoganÃ­s skeleton for a larger
                 demonstration.

                           CYCLOPS
                 For what purpose?

                           BEAST
                 Yes -- Only thereÃ­s a problem.  The
                 mutator gene is not responding to the
                 radiation the way it would in mother
                 nature.  ItÃ­s forcing the bodyÃ­s cells
                 to replicate thousands of times faster
                 than theyÃ­re accustomed to.  The
                 SenatorÃ­s body is literally burning
                 itself out.  Scott -- this machine
                 kills people and I donÃ­t think Magneto
                 realizes it.

                           CYCLOPS
                 So where do you think heÃ­s planning
                 this larger demonstration?

       Jean looks down and sees Xavier pointing with a trembling
       hand, trying to speak.

       Xavier is pointing to the television.

                           XAVIER
                 There...

       He is looking at yet another report on Ellis Island.

       Cyclops and Jean walk over.  All they see on the TV is an
       aerial shot of Manhattan, slowly coming around toward the
       harbor.

       The television image is from the P.O.V. of a helicopter
       circling Ellis Island, taking in all the security and
       construction.  The grand main hall to Ellis Island and
       finally, what the helicopter sees as it comes around for
       one more pass.

       SUDDENLY - The sound of KellyÃ­s heart monitor begins to
       PICK UP SPEED.  Jean rushes to Kelly and touches his pale
       neck.  She draws her hand back quickly as if burned.  The
       heart monitor keeps speeding up until it is racing faster
       than a human heart could possibly produce.

       Jean backs away helplessly.

       The sheet that covers KellyÃ­s body begins to flatten out.
       The sweat covering the hapless SenatorÃ­s body thickens
       into a viscous, clear liquid and begins to run off the
       table.  Kelly is literally melting away.  Cyclops holds
       Jean as she turns away.

       ANGLE ON: THE TV -- the gathering leaders of the world,
       the water clogged with boats, and the thousands of
       onlookers on Manhattan Island.  All well within range.

       INT. READY ROOM - NIGHT

       Storm finishes preparing to leave in another section of
       the ready room.  Beast stands by on his Beast-size
       crutches feeling useless.

                           BEAST
                 I wish I could go.

                           STORM
                 We all do.

                           BEAST
                 Storm.  Try to look for the highest
                 vantage point.
                 From what I can figure, heÃ­ll need to
                 gain as much altitude as possible to
                 blanket the island.  It is my feeling
                 that Magneto has to--

                           STORM
                 Beast.

       Beast looks at her.

                           STORM (contÃ­d)
                 WeÃ­ll be fine.

       INT. LAB - NIGHT

       Cyclops stands looking down at Professor Xavier.  He
       starts to walk away but he is stopped.  He looks down and
       sees that the Professor has weakly grabbed his sleeve.
       Cyclops looks at Xavier but he is still unconscious.  His
       hand falls back to the bed.

                           CYCLOPS
                 You can still hear me... canÃ­t you.

       Xavier lies still.

                           CYCLOPS (contÃ­d)
                 I want to thank you for taking me in.
                 Taking us in...  You have taught me
                 everything in my life that is worth
                 knowing.

       Cyclops grimly regards Xavier.

                           CYCLOPS (contÃ­d)
                 And I want you to know that IÃ­ll take
                 care of them.

       INT. READY ROOM - NIGHT

       Cyclops and Jean get into their uniforms.

       Jean is about to go to the hanger when Cyclops stops her.

                           CYCLOPS
                 Hey.  IÃ­m sorry.  About Logan.  I was
                 jealous.

                           JEAN
                     (putting her arms around him)
                 Well, I think thatÃ­s perfectly
                 understandable.

                           CYCLOPS
                 IÃ­ll tell you one thing though.

                           JEAN
                 WhatÃ­s that?

                           CYCLOPS
                 He calls me sport one more time, and
                 IÃ­ll blow a watermelon-sized hole
                 through him.

       She smiles and kisses him.

                           CYCLOPS (contÃ­d)
                 Now letÃ­s go get him.

       INT. X-JET - NIGHT

       Cyclops, Storm, and Jean board the X-Jet.  They find --
       ROGUE, strapped into a seat, ready to go.

       INT. HANGER - NIGHT

       ROGUE stands outside the jet, obviously having been
       kicked off.

       INT. X-JET - NIGHT

       Jean reaches out a hand.  Cyclops takes it.  They squeeze
       tight.  The X-JetÃ­s engines begin to fire up.

       INT. HANGER - NIGHT

       The hatch slowly starts to swing closed.  From where she
       stands Rogue debates, and then runs, dashing inside as
       the hatch to the X-Jet closes behind her.

       EXT. BASKETBALL COURT - NIGHT

       A basketball sits on the ground near the middle of the
       court.

       Suddenly the asphalt starts to vibrate and the basketball
       rolls a few inches.

       THEN:  There is a grinding noise and the surface begins
       to separate at the half court line.  The basketball falls
       through the widening hole and bounces off the wing of the
       rising X-Jet.

       LIFT-OFF.  The jet turns and clears the hanger before
       blasting off into the night sky.

       EXT. ELLIS ISLAND - NIGHT

       An aerial shot showing us the whole of the event.

       Security of every kind covers every inch of the island.

       Helicopters are coming in at the rate of about one every
       minute to deliver dignitaries and their families from all
       over the globe.

       EXT. ELLIS ISLAND - BRIDGE TO NEW JERSEY - NIGHT

       A steady flow of limos pour onto the island over a simple
       two-lane bridge from New Jersey.

       A NEWSCASTER IN THE FOREGROUND.

                           NEWSCASTER
                 With the ceremonies beginning shortly,
                 it looks as though the last of the
                 dignitaries have landed at Newark and
                 Teterboro airports and will be
                 arriving momentarily.  It would seem
                 the United Nations has had their wish
                 tonight.  There doesnÃ­t seem to be an
                 empty seat in the house.

       EXT. BATTERY PARK - NIGHT

       The pier of the Ferry to Liberty Island.

       A great many families have come to watch curiously the
       going on.

       EXT. MANHATTAN HARBOR - NIGHT

       The harbor is filled with police and Coast Guard vessels
       watching the water closely.

       INT. NEW YORK CITY APARTMENTS/VARIOUS - NIGHT

       A series of shots showing the many folks gathering to
       watch the historic event on television.

       In some of these apartments, Ellis and Liberty islands
       can be seen from their windows in the distance.

       INT. SECURITY CONTROL CENTER - NIGHT

       The OPERATING COMMANDER monitors the countless video
       screens that display nearly every crevice of Ellis Island
       as well as other parts of New York Harbor as well as the
       network news feeds of the event...

       EXT. ELLIS ISLAND - MAIN ENTRANCE - NIGHT

       The front of the Great Hall of Ellis Island, where once
       immigrants poured into the new world by the millions.

       A huge military band off to one side plays music from the
       different countries to help with the milling about and
       shaking of hands.

       The PRESIDENT himself is in the crowd, meeting and
       greeting, a mob of Secret Service always right there.
       Follow him into:

       INT. ELLIS ISLAND - MAIN HALL

       A YASSAR ARAFAT TYPE, who we will call Yassir Arafat,
       comes up to the President and smiles.

       The President introduces his WIFE AND CHILD as more
       delegates approach.

       The two men LAUGH and then HUG to the flashing of a
       million bulbs.

       Smattering of ass-kissy applause.  Arafat and the
       President wave to press and the like.

       EXT. OBSERVATION DECK - ELSEWHERE - NIGHT

       We are looking down on what APPEARS TO BE a deserted part
       of the island.  Away from the action.

       PAN ACROSS THE EDGE OF THE ISLAND

       Every fifty feet or so, uniformed Secret Service agents
       keep tight watch on the island.

       ANGLE ON:

       One Secret Service guy in particular.

       PUSH IN FROM ABOVE - We realize we are pushing in
       unusually fast, as though we are falling.

       WHAM.  A sickening crunch.

       Toad lands on top of the Secret Service guy.  We have
       been watching from his P.O.V.  The Secret Service man is
       tumbled into a heap.  A real frog rabbits O.S.

       Toad looks around quietly, listens...  THEN LEAPS out of
       frame.  Hold on the body of the Secret Service guy.

       LONG PAUSE.

       ANOTHER SICKENING CRUNCH OFF SCREEN.

       EXT. LIBERTY ISLAND - NIGHT

       Two Secret Service guys approach one another.  One is
       holding a smoke, the other is producing a lighter.  Just
       as his smoke is about to hit the flame, the flame dodges
       to one side.  He moves the smoke to follow it, and the
       flame dodges the other way.

       The guy with the smoke looks at the guy with the lighter
       as if to say Ã¬knock it off.Ã®  The guy with the lighter
       shrugs as:

       THE FLAME INSTANTLY GROWS TO A RAGING INTENSITY,
       ENGULFING THEM.

       As they are incinerated and their ashes fall to the
       ground, Pyro climbs into view from the seawall below,
       dripping wet.

       He has come dressed to make trouble tonight.  Strapped to
       his back is an impressive looking flame thrower.  A three
       tanker.

       EXT. SEAWALL - NIGHT

       A Coast Guard boat crawls into view just off shore.  A
       Secret Service man in the foreground waves to the boat as
       it passes by.

       EXT. COAST GUARD BOAT DECK - NIGHT

       A thirty footer.  Fast and sturdy.

       The PILOT OF THE BOAT, a man in his late forties, waves
       back.

       EXT. SEAWALL - NIGHT

       As the Secret Service guy waves, he jolts upright, his
       face contorting in impossible pain.  Slowly, he is lifted
       off the ground.

       EXT. COAST GUARD BOAT DECK - NIGHT

       PILOTÃ­S P.O.V.

       Sabretooth holds the last Secret Service man aloft,
       impaled on his claws.  He waves now, the body swaying
       this way and that before he casually throws it to the
       ground.

       The Pilot turns to the wheel of the boat as he MORPHS
       INTO MYSTIQUE and turns the boat toward the island.

       EXT. BOTTOM OF THE SEAWALL - BOAT - NIGHT

       Man-made rocky shore.  The boat bumps and grinds on the
       rock.  Sabretooth jumps down to the deck and meets
       Magneto coming up from below.  They nod to one another
       and walk toward the front of the boat.  On the deck is
       something covered with a tarp.  Sabretooth pulls back the
       tarp to reveal Logan, still unconscious from the drug.

       ANOTHER, MUCH LARGER OBJECT is on the back of the boat
       under another tarp, but we cannot see what it is.

       Magneto steps off the boat and looks up -- up at
       someplace we cannot yet see.

       EXT. ELLIS ISLAND - GREAT HALL - NIGHT

       The dignitaries take their seats as the ceremony
       commences.

       INT. X-JET - NIGHT

       Cyclops pilots the plane as Manhattan comes into view.
       They bank to the south.  Cyclops checks his monitors.

                           CYCLOPS
                 Radar Stealth Mode checks out.  All
                 right, thereÃ­ll be less security north
                 of the George Washington Bridge.  IÃ­m
                 taking her down.

                           JEAN
                 Into the Hudson?

                           CYCLOPS
                     (smiles)
                 Uh-huh.

       EXT. HUDSON RIVER - NIGHT

       The X-Jet slows to a hover.  ItÃ­s Harrier Jet engines
       tilt back until they are vertical to the water.  The
       engines cycle down and the plane lowers until it is
       hovering a few feet off the surface.

       INT. X-JET - NIGHT

                           CYCLOPS
                 V.T.O.L. off.

       EXT. HUDSON RIVER - NIGHT

       The JetÃ­s engines cut and the plane splashes down into
       the water.  It floats there for a moment and then sinks
       below the surface.

       EXT. BELOW RIVER SURFACE - NIGHT

       As the X-Jet sinks, the hatches close off and the wings
       retract to transform the plane into a submarine.  The
       engines pull tight to the body of the craft and begin to
       propel it forward.

       EXT. HUDSON RIVER - NIGHT

       AERIAL VIEW: The water ripples as the submersed aircraft
       passes under the bridge and into the harbor.

       INT. SMALL ROOM - NIGHT

       C.U. on Logan.  He wakes.  His arms are cuffed behind his
       back.  He is delirious and weakened from the drug.

       He looks around and sees that he is in an oddly shaped
       room with barely enough space for him and Magneto, who
       smiles at him in the half darkness.

                           LOGAN
                     (very weak)
                 Where am I?

                           MAGNETO
                 YouÃ­re backstage at the encore of
                 creation.

       He looks at his watch.

                           MAGNETO (contÃ­d)
                 Three minutes to curtain.

                           LOGAN
                 What are you going to do?

                           MAGNETO
                 In the road to survival, there is
                 always sacrifice Logan.  We are the
                 future... not them.  We must protect
                 ourselves.  After tonight, when the
                 leaders of the world return home --
                 They will return as brothers, as
                 mutants... and our cause will be
                 theirs.  This is survival, I know you
                 understand that, Logan... or is it
                 Wolverine?

       He steps out of the hatch and closes it.

       EXT. LIBERTY ISLAND - NIGHT

       Magneto who looks down.  From atop what, we cannot tell.

       Magneto comes to stand on a railing outside from his high
       perch, overlooking the island.  From here we pull out to
       reveal at last where he is.

       HE IS NOT ON ELLIS ISLAND AT ALL

       Instead, he stands on the catwalk around the torch of the
       Statue of Liberty, about a mile away.
       He has his back to itÃ­s gold translucent flame, looking
       over at the activity on Ellis Island, hearing the band
       and inhaling the cool evening breeze.

                           MAGNETO
                 Give me your tired, your poor...

       And he turns to the bright lights of Manhattan and itÃ­s
       millions of inhabitants.

                           MAGNETO (contÃ­d)
                 ... Your huddled masses.

       He brings a radio to his lips.

                           MAGNETO (contÃ­d)
                 Lights.

       EXT. POWER STATION - NIGHT

       Sabretooth is tearing the padlocks off of the generator
       shed that powers the island.

       INT. POWER STATION - NIGHT

       Sabretooth grabs a hold of a fuse lever marked Ã¬Liberty
       Display LightsÃ® and pulls it down.  Turning it off.

       INT. TORCH - NIGHT

       Logan is now in darkness.  He frantically pulls on his
       binds.  No use.

       INT. X-JET - NIGHT

       Cyclops is monitoring the area above-water on a video
       screen.

                           JEAN
                     (points to the monitor)
                 The lights on the Statue of Liberty
                 are off.

                           STORM
                 Beast said that he would have to take
                 a high vantage point.

       Cyclops, motioning to an open area of water next to
       Liberty Island.

                           CYCLOPS
                 LetÃ­s dock over there.

       Cyclops pulls a lever.  The X-Jet begins to surface.

                           CYCLOPS (contÃ­d)
                 Storm, give us some cover.

       INT. APARTMENTS/VARIOUS - NIGHT

       Televisions all over the city show the Statue sitting
       dark to countless curious viewers.

       INT. X-JET - NIGHT

       The water level outside the X-Jet lowers as the plane
       surfaces.

       EXT. X-JET - NIGHT

       The plane rises until it is nearly flush with the surface
       of the water -- Not a hundred yards from an obvious Coast
       Guard cutter.  Out the jetÃ­s window, the Statue rises
       away into the fog that is now rolling in over the Harbor.

       INT. SECURITY CONTROL CENTER - NIGHT

       ANGLE ON:

       The OPERATIONS COMMANDER raises a radio to his mouth.

                           OPERATION COMMANDER
                 Liberty One, Liberty One, this is
                 Horizon, do you copy.

       AN AGENTÃ­S VOICE RESPONDS.

                           AGENTÃ­S VOICE
                 Go, Horizon.

                           OPERATION COMMANDER
                     (on radio)
                 Liberty, whatÃ­s the situation with the
                 lights, over?

       EXT. LIBERTY ISLAND - NIGHT

       IT IS MYSTIQUE.  The lower part of her face and the whole
       her neck are that of a stocky man.

                           MYSTIQUE/AGENTÃ­S VOICE
                 Uhhh, Horizon, weÃ­ve seem to have had
                 a shutdown at the generator, weÃ­re
                 five by five.  There now, checking it
                 out.  Everything is fine other-wise.

                           OPERATION COMMANDER
                     (on radio)
                 Roger Liberty one.  Horizon out.

       She MORPHS back into her full self and smiles.

                           MYSTIQUE
                 Darling...  WeÃ­re clear.

       EXT. SEAWALL - NIGHT

       Jean, Cyclops, Storm and Rogue step off the wing tip of
       the X-Jet onto the island.  They climb over the fog
       encased seawall and stand staring up at the Statue and
       the desolate island.

       EXT. TORCH - NIGHT

       Magneto takes this moment in the darkness to point his
       hands and all of his concentration on the bottom of the
       torch.

       The air RIPPLES with magnetic energy as -- the cap-like
       end piece of the torch begins to vibrate, metal groans,
       twists...

       WITH A CRACK OF METAL, it comes free, dropping to the
       ground.

       INT. TORCH - NIGHT

       Logan stares down through the hollow torch as the cap
       falls away into the fog.

       EXT. STATUE - BOTTOM - NIGHT

       The foursome are deciding how to proceed.

                           CYCLOPS
                 We should check out operations, see if
                 the Secret Service is still around.

       Storm is surveying the layout of the island.  She looks
       up at the Statue.

                           STORM
                 LOOK OUT.

       They all look up.  The cap of the torch is SCREAMING DOWN
       towards them out of the sky.  It crashes down as they
       leap out of the way.

                           CYCLOPS
                 IÃ­m going to assume that means that
                 the Secret Service is out of
                 commission.  Jean, can you raise me up
                 there?

                           JEAN
                 ItÃ­s too far.

                           CYCLOPS
                     (assessing the situation)
                 Storm, Rogue, -- you take the south
                 entrance.
                     (pointing to the main
                      entrance)
                 Jean and I will go in here.

       Storm and Rogue start for the south entrance.

                           CYCLOPS (contÃ­d)
                     (to Storm and Rogue)
                 IÃ­ll see you both soon.

       EXT. TORCH - NIGHT

       Magneto prepares to execute the next stage of his plan
       when he looks out over the island.  A DENSE FOG has
       rolled in, obscuring his view of the bottom half of the
       Statue.  He looks out towards Ellis Island and sees that
       the fog is localized over Liberty Island.

                           MAGNETO
                     (into radio)
                 Be careful everyone...  I think we may
                 have company.

       EXT. SEAWALL - NIGHT

       The Coast Guard boat Magneto came in on.  The giant tarp
       on the boat and what is under it.

       IT RISES IN THE AIR, standing upright.  The tarp slides
       to the deck to reveal:

       THE MACHINE.  The one Kelly and Xavier saw.  The air
       ripples as it rises higher in the air.

       INT. MUSEUM - NIGHT

       Storm and Rogue quietly enter the StatueÃ­s museum.  It is
       filled with scale models and full size displays
       documenting the history of Lady Liberty.  One display
       showcasing the METAL STRIPS which line the Statue for
       support.  They quickly head for an exit on the far side
       of the room.

       SUDDENLY:

       The lights go out.  Darkness.

       A low guttural CROAK echoes in the void.

                           STORM
                     (whispering)
                 Rogue... run.

       Rogue runs into the darkness, heading for the exit.  She
       dashes past a six foot copper replica of the Statue and
       out the door.

       As soon as Rogue is past, the StatueÃ­s HEAD TURNS and
       watches her go.  The replica blinks and the eyes turn
       Mystique yellow.

       INT. TORCH - NIGHT

       The machine is rising.  Logan yanks at the manacles in an
       attempt to pull his hands free.

       INT. OLD TORCH ROOM - NIGHT

       A giant room that welcomes the many visitors to the
       Statue.  In the center is the old torch, placed there
       after the StatueÃ­s 1986 restoration.  The only light in
       the room is a soft red glow that emanates from the old
       torch.

       Cyclops notices a map of the Statue on a pedestal.

                           CYCLOPS
                 Over there.

       Cyclops and Jean study the map, looking for the way to
       the torch.  In front of them is the old torch.  ItÃ­s
       eerie red glow is growing brighter.

       EXT. STATUE - TORCH - NIGHT

       THE MACHINE rises up and into the bottom of the torch
       itself.

       INT. TORCH - NIGHT

       The machine is now almost on him.  LoganÃ­s struggles
       turns to rage.  SHOOK -- He pops his claws and
       frantically cuts at the wall behind him, as the machine
       draws closer.

       INT. MUSEUM - NIGHT

       We hear an ominous LOW RUMBLE, as you hear on an overcast
       day just before a thunderstorm.  SHEETS OF HEAT LIGHTNING
       begin to roll across the ceiling, lighting the room in
       sporadic bursts.

       Toad darts around the room.

       FLASH -- Reptile eyes -- DARKNESS.

       FLASH -- A WEBBED CLAW -- closer -- DARKNESS.

       FLASH -- leaping body -- closer -- DARKNESS.

       Silence.  Darkness.

       The heat lightning continues to expose the room in
       rolling flashes.

       Silence.  Darkness.

       Suddenly, behind Storm the sound of ELEVATOR DOORS
       OPENING.  Storm spins and unleashes a BOLT OF LIGHTNING.
       The lightning strikes an empty GLASS HYDRAULIC ELEVATOR
       SHAFT.  No TOAD.

       INT. OLD TORCH ROOM - NIGHT

       ANGLE ON: The map of the statue.  Cyclops watches as the
       dim red glow turns brighter and brighter.  He turns to
       look up at the old torch -- it glows FIERY RED HOT.

                           CYCLOPS
                 Get down!

       THE TORCH EXPLODES.

       A RING OF FIRE wipes across the room.

       Cyclops and Jean duck behind the marble map pedestal as
       fire whips around them.

       Move up through the CEILING OF FIRE to reveal Pyro at the
       center of the old torch.  His eyes wide, manipulating the
       fire like an orchestra conductor.

       INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE THE MUSEUM - NIGHT

       Rogue runs down the hallway, she stops.  The sound of
       footsteps echo from behind her.  The footsteps quicken
       from walking to running.  Rogue runs to get away as the
       footsteps of her pursuer get closer.

       INT. MUSEUM - NIGHT

       Darkness.  Silence -- except for the sound of StormÃ­s own
       breathing.  StormÃ­s eyes dart around the room, her senses
       are in overdrive.

       Suddenly, SLIME drips onto her cheek.  A low guttural
       CROAK.  Storm looks up -- TOAD clings to the ceiling.

       WHAM.  Webbed feet slam into StormÃ­s chest sending her
       flying into the elevator shaft.  She crashes helplessly
       to the bottom -- stunned.

       ToadÃ­s head peers through the open elevator doors to the
       level below, looking down on the helpless Storm.  Toad
       SMILES.  His webbed finger presses the elevator button.

       The elevator doors above her close, sealing her in the
       glass tubular shaft.
       The ROAR of the hydraulic engine coming to life, the
       elevator begins its crushing descent down toward Storm as
       she lies at the bottom of the shaft dazed.

       INT. OLD TORCH ROOM - NIGHT

       C.U. on Jean and Cyclops both pinned down.

       Fire sweeps around the map pedestal.  Cyclops turns.

       BOOM -- He fires a series of OPTIC BLASTS blindly through
       the fire, blasting the ceiling.

       Chunks of debris from the ceiling shower down onto Pyro.
       The inferno stops.

       Smoke fills the room, Jean tries to catch her breath.
       Cyclops stands and heads toward the old torch trying to
       draw a bead on Pyro.  Cyclops doesnÃ­t see him.  When:

       A COLUMN OF FIRE erupts from the thick smoke, rocketing
       at Cyclops.

       Cyclops dodges, flipping a heavy wood table with flaming
       pamphlets on it -- using it as a shield against PyroÃ­s
       fiery onslaught.

       EXT. TORCH - BACK - NIGHT

       ANGLE FROM DIRECTLY OVERHEAD:

       Magneto on the side of the torchÃ­s flame raises the huge
       machine -- while on the other side -- LOGAN PUSHES
       HIMSELF THROUGH THE HOLE -- his hands still bound behind
       his back, and slams against the outer railing of the
       torch.

       Logan looks around in shock.  He realizes where he is.
       He looks out at all the activity on Ellis Island, drawing
       a greater understanding of MagnetoÃ­s plan.

       EXT. TORCH - FRONT - NIGHT

       With a MAGNETIC RIPPLE of the air Magneto drives the
       machine right up through the bottom of the torch like
       batteries in a flashlight.

       EXT. TORCH - BACK - NIGHT

       Logan turns his back to the hole he has just emerged from
       and braces his cuffs against the rising machine.  The
       machine pushes against LoganÃ­s wrists driving his cuffs
       up against the top of the hole.

       CRACK.

       The pressure leaves the cuffs apart.

       INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT

       StormÃ­s eyes open, looking straight up.

       ANGLE ON: The elevator continuing its crushing descent.

       Storm struggles to her feet.  Her hand presses against
       the thick glass elevator shaft, it surrounds her like a
       coffin.

       LIGHTNING strike the glass -- to no effect.

       Storm frantically searches for a way out.  She looks up
       to see the elevator closing fast.

       Storm raises her hands above her head.  WIND begins to
       lift StormÃ­s hair.  The wind picks up and starts swirling
       violently against the sides of the elevator shaft.

       Wildly, the wind whips around causing a CYCLONE within
       the glass shaft buffeting upwards against the elevator.

       The elevator groans as the hydraulics fight the
       unrelenting vortex of wind.  Smoke begins to pour from
       the hydraulics, which whine in protest.  At the center of
       the tornado stands Storm, a force of nature.

       As the elevator continues its descent the cyclone pushes
       outward.  Small cracks start to appear on the glass
       walls.

       She is now forced almost to the ground.  The elevator is
       now inches from StormÃ­s head.  The floor is made of a
       thicker version of the same Plexiglas and we look up
       through it, the massive elevator looming over Storm.

       BOOM.

       The glass walls explode outward, showering the museum.

       Storm partly rolls and is partly blown from the shaft to
       safety.  The pressure of the cyclone released, the
       elevator SLAMS to the bottom.

       INT. OLD TORCH ROOM - NIGHT

       Jean, having caught her breath, looks over to:

       C.U. on Cyclops.  HeÃ­s pinned down as fire wraps around
       the table -- the fire is burning through.

       Jean, seeing Cyclops defenseless, stands up from behind
       the marble podium.  She quickly scans the room and spots,
       on opposite walls near the old torch, TWO LARGE FIRE
       EXTINGUISHERS.

       Jean stretches out her fists and focuses her telekinesis.

       Pyro spots Jean -- with one hand continuing to blast
       Cyclops, he uses the other to unleash an ARM OF FIRE
       toward Jean.

       Jean focuses as she brings her outstretched fists closer
       together.  Suddenly -- the two fire extinguishers crash
       through their glass holders.

       Like two gunslingers in a showdown.

       The extinguishers bullet toward Pyro.

       The arm of fire rockets closer to Jean.

       Suddenly, the EXTINGUISHERS COLLIDE EXPLODING in front of
       Pyro.

       Inches from JeanÃ­s face, the ARM OF FIRE disappears.

       The COLUMN OF FLAMES against Scott VANISHES.  The flames
       once covering the room are gone, a choking smoke is all
       that remains.

       Through the smoke, at the center of the old torch, Pyro
       lies dead, covered in a sea of white foam.

       Jean starts choking on the smoke.  Cyclops stands and
       motions for her to get out of the smoke filled room.

       EXT. TORCH - FRONT - NIGHT

       The machine finally locks into place.  Magneto raises a
       walkie talkie to his face.

                           MAGNETO
                 Lights on.

       INT. POWER STATION - NIGHT

       Sabretooth grabs a hold of the lever for the Ã¬Liberty
       DisplayÃ® power breaker and pulls up.  Turning it on.

       INT. ELLIS ISLAND - GREAT HALL - NIGHT

       The lights of the Statue come back on.  The crowd of
       dignitaries burst into enthusiastic applause as if it is
       part of the proceedings.

       INT. SECURITY CONTROL CENTER - NIGHT

       The Statue now lit up in the monitors.

                           OPERATION COMMANDER
                 Roger.  We see the lights.

       EXT. TORCH - FRONT - NIGHT

       Magneto turns and opens the hatch.  Magneto sees the hole
       -- Logan is gone.

       EXT. TORCH - BACK - NIGHT

       Magneto walks over and stares at the hole, clearly out by
       LoganÃ­s claws.

       Magneto looks at his fingers after wiping the edge of the
       hole.  LoganÃ­s blood.  Magneto looks down and sees
       LoganÃ­s claw marks down the arm of the Statue, marking
       his escape.

       Magneto scans the island from his high perch.  He does
       not see Logan.

       EXT. STATUE - MAIN ENTRANCE - NIGHT

       The doors to the old torch room burst open -- SMOKE
       BILLOWS OUT.  Jean runs out coughing violently.

       Suddenly, Toad lands in front of Jean, grabs her head and
       before she can react, his tongue launches at her face.

       His tongue covers her face with an ADHESIVE SLIME.  Jean
       falls to the ground.  Toad looks back at the main
       entrance, sees Cyclops emerging and LEAPS up, out of
       frame.

       ANGLE ON:

       Cyclops stumbles out of the smoke filled building.
       Seeing Jean lying on the ground, he runs to her.

       Cyclops turns Jean on her back, ready to perform CPR.  He
       is shocked, the slime has now hardened to JeanÃ­s face.
       She is suffocating.  He desperately tries to pry it off.

       ANGLE ON:

       The camera quickly pulls higher and higher revealing --

       TOADÃ­S P.O.V.

       EXT. OBSERVATION DECK - NIGHT

       Toad looks down, perched on top of the railing
       surrounding the base of the Statue -- the same position
       he had before crushing the Secret Service agent.

       Toad arches his back ready to spring downward.  He will
       kill two birds with one crushing leap.

       The sound of WIND.

       C.U. ToadÃ­s face static, his eyes slowly look to the
       side.  His head twists, looking over his shoulder.  Storm
       stands behind him.

       Toad turns and hops off the railing towards Storm.

       C.U. on TOADÃ­S FACE.  Which is horrible.

                           TOAD
                 DonÃ­t you people die?

       Suddenly the wind picks up violently.  Toad moves closer
       -- fighting the wind.

       Storm is MAD.  A face we remember seeing on a young girl
       in Africa.

       Toad fights the gale force winds, his webbed feet
       adhering to the ground.  He inches closer to Storm.  Toad
       bares his FANGS.

       EXT. STATUE - MAIN ENTRANCE - NIGHT

       On the ground Cyclops notices the wind howling with rage
       above him.  He frantically pulls on the encrusted slime
       suffocating Jean.

       EXT. OBSERVATION DECK - NIGHT

       StormÃ­s eyes widen.  HURRICANE force winds blast Toad.
       Try as he might to use his sticky feet to hold on, Toad
       is blown back off his feet, catching the deck with his
       hands.

       The piece of the deck TEARS LOOSE still attached to
       ToadÃ­s hands.  He flies off the deck, past the metal
       railing.  ToadÃ­s tongue LASHES OUT AND ATTACHES TO THE
       RAILING.  For a moment, Toad just flaps there like a
       flag.

       Storm RAISES HER ARMS.

       CRASH -- A huge BOLT OF LIGHTNING strikes the railing.

       Toad is blown off the railing in a flash of electricity
       and --

       EXT. HARBOR - NIGHT

       Toad lands in the water.  He disappears below the surface
       leaving nothing but bubbles.

       EXT. OBSERVATION DECK - NIGHT

       Storm moves to the railing.  She looks down at Cyclops
       and Jean.  Suddenly, the metal railing on which her hands
       rest BEGIN TO BEND TOWARD HER.

       EXT. STATUE - MAIN ENTRANCE - NIGHT

       Cyclops continues to pull on the slime.  JeanÃ­s struggles
       are becoming more panicked.

       Cyclops stops and puts his hands on JeanÃ­s shoulders,
       pinning her down.

                           CYCLOPS
                 Jean.  Jean stop.  Stop moving.

       Jean continues to struggle for a moment.  She starts to
       calm down, her chest still hitching involuntarily for
       air.

                           CYCLOPS (contÃ­d)
                 Jean, trust me.  DonÃ­t move.

       He takes a hold of her chin and grips it tightly.  He
       FIRES A THIN, FOCUSED OPTIC BEAM INTO THE ENCRUSTED
       SLIME, splitting it in half.  He pulls the remains away
       from her face.

       Jean GASPS for air.  Then she looks up.  Her face turns
       to horror.  Behind Cyclops, towering over him is --
       Sabretooth.

       WHAM!  Sabretooth smashes down.

       BLACK

       INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE THE MUSEUM - NIGHT

       Rogue turns the corner of the hallway and trips, tumbling
       to the ground.

       Rogue watches from the floor as the shadow of her pursuer
       bends around the corner.  The sound of their footsteps
       get closer.  The shadow is upon her, turning the corner.

       It is LOGAN.

                           LOGAN
                 I didnÃ­t mean to scare you.

                           ROGUE
                 Thank God.  Logan... we have to help
                 Storm we have to.

       Logan looks around to make sure itÃ­s clear.

                           LOGAN
                 IÃ­ll go back, but first let me find
                 you a safe place.

       Logan extends his hand.

                           LOGAN (contÃ­d)
                 Here, take my hand.

       Rogue looks at Logan confused.  Logan grows impatient.

                           LOGAN (contÃ­d)
                 Take it!

       ANGLE ON: Over LoganÃ­s shoulder.  On the back of his neck
       we see some BLUE SCALES.  Logan is not Logan, Logan is
       MYSTIQUE.

       INT. STATUE - HEAD - NIGHT

       E.C.U.-on MagnetoÃ­s belt, which is lined with METAL
       STRAPS.  MagnetoÃ­s hand comes into frame holding CYCLOPSÃ­
       VISOR and places it against one of the straps.  The strap
       WRAPS ITSELF BACK AND AROUND, pinning the visor to the
       belt.  He brings a radio to his mouth.

                           MAGNETO
                     (into radio)
                 Mystique...  Mystique, where are you?

       Magneto turns to Sabretooth.

                           MAGNETO (contÃ­d)
                 Find Logan.

       Sabretooth exits as Magneto turns to reveal --

       Jean and Cyclops, without his visor, are trapped in a
       hideous tangle of metal (taken from the StatueÃ­s steel
       bracing) forcing the two to face each other.  Two sharp
       points of metal rest on either side of CyclopsÃ­ head,
       locking it in position.  CyclopsÃ­ is close enough to feel
       JeanÃ­s breath -- if he opens his eyes, he will destroy
       everything in his path, including Jean.

       Storm is also encased in a myriad of sharp metal bands,
       pinning her to the wall.  Razor sharp pieces of metal
       warp and close on her throat.

       All in all, they are completely disabled.

       Jean struggles to free them with her telekinesis, to no
       avail.

                           CYCLOPS
                     (whispering)
                 Jean... can you?

                           JEAN
                     (whispering)
                 IÃ­m sorry.  IÃ­m not strong enough.

       Magneto stands next to Storm.  Close.

                           MAGNETO
                     (whispering)
                 If the temperature changes a single
                 degree...
                     (looking at Jean)
                 I only need one hostage.

       Magneto stares icily at Storm.

       As if to accentuate the threat, a piece of metal pokes
       ever so slightly into the side of StormÃ­s throat.

                           MAGNETO (contÃ­d)
                     (raising his voice)
                 Now if you can hear me Logan...

       EXT. SEAWALL - NIGHT

       We find Logan -- The real Logan.  He has made it off the
       Statue and is about to jump off the seawall.  He stops
       suddenly.

       E.C.U. of his ear.  His powerful hearing enables him to
       hear Magneto.

                           MAGNETO (V.O.)
                 ... and I know you can -- It is a five
                 minute run from the furthest distance
                 on this island.  If you are not back
                 in this time...  I will kill these
                 friends of XavierÃ­s.  Including the
                 young lady from the gymnasium.  I
                 think they came here to Ã¬rescue you.Ã®

       INT. STATUE - HEAD - NIGHT

       Magneto looks to his hand -- the CHIP from Cerebro.

                           MAGNETO (contÃ­d)
                 I also have a small piece of Cerebro
                 that might be of interest to you, if
                 you hope to save Charles Xavier.

       EXT. SEAWALL - NIGHT

                           MAGNETO (V.O.)
                 Xavier is dying you know.  Five
                 minutes Logan.

       LoganÃ­s face shows the frustration.  Again, he is forced
       to make a decision.

       INT. STATUE - HEAD - NIGHT

       Magneto pulls out the chip taken from Cerebro and walks
       over to Jean.

                           MAGNETO
                 Here -- XavierÃ­s life.

       He tucks it in an exposed part of her uniform.

                           MAGNETO (contÃ­d)
                 If I get what I want, you can try and
                 save him... for old times sake.

       Magneto turns to Storm.

                           MAGNETO (contÃ­d)
                 Now... shall we talk about the
                 weather.

       INT. ELLIS ISLAND - MAIN ENTRANCE - NIGHT

       The President addresses the audience.  We move across all
       the worldÃ­s leaders sitting with their families.  Men,
       women and children of every race, color and creed that
       the planet Earth has to offer.

       INT. STATUE - HEAD - NIGHT

                           JEAN
                 Magneto.  IÃ­ve seen the results of
                 your machine.  IÃ­ve seen Senator
                 Kelly.

                           MAGNETO
                 Ahhhh, so the good Senator survived
                 his fall?  And the swim to shore?  He
                 is stronger than I ever could have
                 imagined.

                           JEAN
                 The experiment was a failure.  Kelly
                 didnÃ­t make it.  Yes, you were
                 successful in activating his mutator
                 gene, but you failed to take into
                 account the rest of his body -- it
                 wasnÃ­t ready for the strain.
                 Kelly was dead within hours.  Your
                 machine kills.

                           MAGNETO
                 Quiet...

       Magneto pauses.  Shock registering on his face that he
       could be wrong.  Thinking.  Considering what Jean is
       telling him.  His mind races and calculates the
       possibility.  Then:

                           MAGNETO (contÃ­d)
                 I donÃ­t believe you.

                           JEAN
                 You donÃ­t understand.

       Magneto gets angry -- squeezing the metal surrounding
       JeanÃ­s head.  Jean gasps.  This drives Cyclops crazy, but
       he is helpless to stop it.

                           CYCLOPS
                     (yelling)
                 Stop it!

                           MAGNETO
                 Why canÃ­t you see what I am trying to
                 do?  Why do you stand in my way?

       MagnetoÃ­s anger is boiling over.

       THUD -- the sound of footsteps, then another and another.
       The faces around the room look at the stairs as the
       footsteps get closer and louder.

                           MAGNETO (contÃ­d)
                 Check and mate.

       PAUSE.

       SUDDENLY:  SHOOK -- LoganÃ­s claws shoot up through the
       floor, and through MagnetoÃ­s feet.  Magneto howls.  The
       claws retract and Magneto falls.

       Magneto, writhes in pain, rolling onto his stomach.

       Logan quickly comes up the stairs and into the StatueÃ­s
       head.  He stands over the crippled Magneto.

       Logan turns to Jean who is still pressed eye to eye with
       Cyclops.  He is relieved to see her alive.

       ANGLE ON: Storm.  She sees something.  Several of the
       steel bands that support the top of the StatueÃ­s head
       begin to move.

                           STORM
                 Logan!

       THREE METAL BAND peel off the ceiling, coming to life
       with magnetic energy.  They leap across the room and wrap
       around Logan.  Forcing his fists to press against his
       chest.

       Should he so much as extend his claws, he will rupture
       his own vitals.  The metal bands wrap behind his back.

       Magneto raises his hand and MAGNETIC WAVES RIPPLE.  Metal
       groans as Magneto peels open a gaping hole in the top of
       Lady LibertyÃ­s head.  Magneto looks up at the torch.  The
       wind howls.

       The AIR RIPPLES again as Magneto levitates the steel
       bands holding Logan, lifting Logan off the ground and out
       the hole in the StatueÃ­s head.

       EXT. STATUE - HEAD - NIGHT

       MAGNETIC WAVES thrust Logan through the air and --

       INT. TORCH - NIGHT

       WHAM -- THROUGH the metal skin of the flame.  Logan lands
       in the center of the sphere on top of the machine.

       Inside the sphere is a metal structure resembling the
       model of an atom.  Its rings expand as it receives Logan.

       Logan looks through the hole in the frame, down into the
       hole in the StatueÃ­s head, at Magneto.

       INT. STATUE - HEAD - NIGHT

       Magneto struggles to his feet, pulling himself up by his
       hands.  Magneto stares at Logan, impatient.

       Magneto stands with a hand raised up toward the machine.
       Then a slight motion of his wrist --

       INT. TORCH - NIGHT

       The rings start revolving just as it did with Kelly, back
       at the lair.  Spinning slowly, then gaining in speed.

       The air around it RIPPLES, gaining in intensity.

       INT. STATUE - HEAD - NIGHT

       MAGNETIC ENERGY POURS from MagnetoÃ­s hands toward the
       machine, behind him Jean and Storm watch helplessly.

       INT. TORCH - NIGHT

       The rings are spinning around Logan at such a speed, the
       rings themselves are no longer visible -- merely a blur
       around the stationary Logan.

       Logan yells.  Unthinkable pain, his skeleton beginning to
       glow through his skin.

       His eyes look down, through the hole in the torch, into
       the StatueÃ­s head, searching for Jean.

       The deafening whine builds louder and louder.

       INT. STATUE - HEAD - NIGHT

       Magneto looks at the incredible displays as MAGNETIC
       ENERGY flows from his hands continuing to charge the
       machine.

       Mystique emerges from the stairwell behind Magneto.  Her
       eyes widen in awe.

                           MAGNETO
                 Ahh, there you are.

       Mystique walks slowly toward magneto.  Storm and Jean
       watch the torch in horror.

                           JEAN
                     (to Mystique)
                 You have to stop him, the machine...
                 it kills people...

       Mystique ignores Jean.  She stops behind Magneto.  She
       looks up and sees Logan staring back in agony.

                           JEAN (contÃ­d)
                 ... Please do something.

       Magneto tilts his head slightly, acknowledging Jean, but
       not moving from his task.

                           MYSTIQUE
                 DonÃ­t listen to her... itÃ­s a trap.

       Magneto turns.

                           MAGNETO
                 What is?

                           MYSTIQUE
                 This is.

       And she grabs the sides of his face and kisses him
       deeply.  There is an awkward moment.  Until:

       MAGNETO CONVULSES.  Once, then again.  Then he struggles
       to be set free.

       And MYSTIQUE TRANSFORMS INTO ROGUE.

       It has been her all along, using SHAPE SHIFTING powers
       borrowed from the real Mystique.

       Magneto fights to get free, but his power is being
       drained from him.

                           JEAN
                 ROGUE, DESTROY THE MACHINE!

       Rogue goes to pull away, BUT MAGNETO WONÃ­T LET HER GO.

       Magneto grabs hold of RogueÃ­s throat -- CHOKING HER.

       INT. TORCH - NIGHT

       Logan looking down, through the hole in the StatueÃ­s head
       for Jean, sees Rogue and Magneto struggle.

       Logan watches helplessly as MAGNETO STRANGLES ROGUE.

       LOGAN YELLS -- THE WHITE LIGHT BEGINS TO EMANATE FROM HIS
       BODY.  His flesh starts to SMOLDER.

       INT. STATUE - HEAD - NIGHT

       Magneto is strangling Rogue, who clings to his face --
       drawing his powers.

       The walls GROAN as magnetic energy RIPPLES through the
       StatueÃ­s head.

       ANGLE ON:

       Rogue, choking to death, looks frantically at Cyclops for
       help.  She raises one of her hands and uses MagnetoÃ­s
       stolen power to BEND BACK THE METAL POINTS so that
       Cyclops is able to move his head again.  Without his
       visor however, he is still unable to open his eyes.

       Magneto, feeling the last of his power draining from him,
       grabs Rogue tightly and SLAMS her into the wall.  Rogue
       slumps in MagnetoÃ­s arms and the two collapse to the
       ground.

       INT. TORCH - NIGHT

       The sound from the machine is DEAFENING.  SUDDENLY --

       SILENCE.

       ABSOLUTE SILENCE.

       At the silence, all eyes turn to the torch.

       It is too late -- THE MACHINE IS FULLY CHARGED.

       LoganÃ­s eyes tense.  He clenches his teeth.  Logan does
       the unthinkable.

       SHOOK.

       The glowing white claws extend through LoganÃ­s chest and
       out his back cutting three metal straps binding him.
       Logan ROARS in pain as he --

       Pulls his claws from his chest.

       SLASH -- his claws rip through the inside of the machine -
       - cutting apart the rings spinning around him.

       The translucent torch of the Statue is CUT TO PIECES BY
       THE FLYING METAL.

       INT. ELLIS ISLAND - GREAT HALL - NIGHT

       The President and the dignitaries turn.  Secret Service
       rush to the window.  A wave of panic sweeps the crowd.

       INT. SECURITY CONTROL CENTER - NIGHT

       The flaming torch lights up one of many screens.

                           OPERATION COMMANDER
                 Liberty one this is Horizon...  I
                 repeat... do you copy?  Liberty one
                 this is Horizon ... I repeat... do you
                 copy?

       EXT. STATUE - TORCH - NIGHT

       Where the flame of the torch once stood, now stands
       Logan, his skeleton cooling down.

       Logan leans on the torchÃ­s railing, his chest bleeds from
       the six claw wounds.  Logan is exhausted.  He looks down
       at his comrades still trapped by the metal bands.  And
       Magneto lying powerless on the floor.  SUDDENLY, from
       below --

       A MASSIVE CLAWED HAND strikes LoganÃ­s chest.  The blow
       sends Logan sailing back to the far end of the torch.

       Logan lies against the railing.  Opening his eyes he sees
       --

       TWO CLAWED FEET following upward to a very angry, very
       large Sabretooth, towering over him.

       Sabretooth leaps at Logan.  Against the New York skyline
       THEY GO AT IT, SLASHING AND HOWLING.

       EXT. MANHATTAN HARBOR - NIGHT

       Several Coast Guard cutters head full-speed toward
       Liberty Island.

       ANGLE ON: Their decks covered with armed Secret Service.

       EXT. TORCH - NIGHT

       Sabretooth picks up Logan over his head and throws him
       like a rag doll into the railing on the other side of the
       torch.

       Logan struggles to his feet -- dazed.  Suddenly,
       Sabretooth, running at full steam, tackles him.  Slamming
       Logan into the railing.

       The metal railing bends.

       Sabretooth holds Logan by his wrists, trying to push him
       over the edge.  It is several hundred feet to the ground
       below.

       Logan is weakening.  Sabretooth is in complete control,
       he leans down near LoganÃ­s ear.

                           SABRETOOTH
                     (whispering)
                 Your girlfriend is next.

       With all his might, Logan pushes his clenched fists as
       close to SabretoothÃ­s face as he can.  SHOOK!  The claws
       pop.  Sabretooth springs back to protect his face.

       LOGAN KICKS WITH ALL HIS MIGHT AND SABRETOOTH flies back
       to the other side of the torch.

       LOGAN leaps up and running at full speed, tackles
       Sabretooth -- like a train plowing into a stalled car.

       The metal railing snaps and they both go flying through
       the air.

       EXT. STATUE - HEAD - NIGHT

       CRACK.

       Sabretooth and Logan slam onto the top of the StatueÃ­s
       head.

       Logan rolls off the back of the StatueÃ­s head and falls.

       Sabretooth stands and looks over the edge - nothing.  All
       he can see is the StatueÃ­s body curving away towards the
       ground.  He smiles, and turns back to the hole.

       EXT. STATUE - HEAD - NIGHT

       ANGLE ON: LOGAN - Hanging from the ear of the Statue, the
       claws of his right hand embedded in the lobe at the end
       of three sets of long claw-marks.

       He looks up.  A look of brutal determination crosses his
       face.  Straining, he pulls himself up by his right arm.
       The cords stand out on his neck as he tries to get to
       shoulder level.  He aims his left claw a little further
       up on the ear and --

       THUNK.

       He drives it in.

       INT. STATUE - HEAD - NIGHT

       WHAM -- E.C.U. SabretoothÃ­s feet as he lands on the metal
       floor.  He quickly takes in the situation, Magneto and
       Rogue are still unconscious.  He walks towards Storm.

       The air in the room starts to CRACKLE and SabretoothÃ­s
       hair begins to stand on end as it did when these two last
       confronted each other.

                           SABRETOOTH
                 I donÃ­t think so.

       Sabretooth backhands Storm across the jaw, knocking her
       out.  As her head drops, he draws his claws and slashes
       it down.  It STOPS, just before tearing open StormÃ­s
       throat, HELD BY AN UNSEEN FORCE.  He turns and sees that
       Jean has focused her power in his arm.  He smiles.

       He walks to Jean and tears off her bonds.  He reaches out
       to grab her neck but his claw is stopped again in mid-
       air.  Sabretooth just smiles wider and forces his hand
       forward.  The outcome never really in doubt, the claw
       wraps around JeanÃ­s neck.  She begins to choke.

                           CYCLOPS
                 Jean!

       Sabretooth lifts Jean by the neck and walks away from
       Cyclops as he chokes her.

                           SABRETOOTH
                 Sorry about this sweetheart, but I
                 made Logan a promise.

       Jean struggles desperately against SabretoothÃ­s
       unbreakable grip, the life draining from her.  Then --

                           LOGAN (O.S.)
                 Hey, ya big pussy.

       Sabretooth whips around, still clutching Jean to see -
       LOGAN -

       Bleeding, beaten and panting, and yet still standing
       defiantly over MagnetoÃ­s unconscious body.

                           LOGAN (contÃ­d)
                 I ainÃ­t finished with you yet.

       Sabretooth looks at him, disbelieving that this man can
       still be standing, let alone challenging him... and he
       starts to laugh.

                           SABRETOOTH
                 You?

       Logan grins.

                           LOGAN
                 Not just me.

       And with that: he extends ONE CLAW from his right hand,
       squats down, and cuts the piece of metal holding CyclopsÃ­
       visor to MagnetoÃ­s belt.  He lifts it up and it slides
       down his claw to his hand.  He casually throws it in the
       air.

                           LOGAN (contÃ­d)
                 Jean?

       Logan looks at the visor and it freezes in the air.

       It flies across the room, right past SabretoothÃ­s head.
       He lunges at it with his free claw but just misses it.

       The visor lands square on CyclopsÃ­ eyes, and attaches
       itself to CyclopsÃ­ face.

       He turns.

       BOOM!

       A focused OPTIC BLAST hits Sabretooth like a FREIGHT
       TRAIN.  He drops Jean and SLAMS THROUGH THE WALL.

       EXT. STATUE - NIGHT

       We see the side of the StatueÃ­s head.  Suddenly,
       Sabretooth BLASTS THROUGH THE EYE.

       For a moment CyclopsÃ­ beam continues to fire through the
       eye as if the Statue itself is imitating CyclopsÃ­ power.

       EXT. SEAWALL - NIGHT

       MagnetoÃ­s boat still sits quietly next to the seawall.

       CRASH.

       SabretoothÃ­s body SMASHES THROUGH THE ROOF of the boat.
       The tarp flies up and drifts back down to rest over
       SabretoothÃ­s body.

       INT. STATUE - HEAD - NIGHT

       LoganÃ­s breathing is strained, a blood stain in the
       middle of his shirt, but he is in control.  Logan looks
       up, his eyes met by JeanÃ­s.

       He walks over to Storm and Cyclops and SHOOK! cuts them
       loose.  Jean and Cyclops catch Storm, who begins to come
       around.

       Cyclops smiles.  Logan kneels down beside Rogue.  He
       wants to comfort her but cannot touch her.  She opens her
       eyes and sees Logan.

                           ROGUE
                 Hey...  There you are.
                     (sudden apprehension)
                 Is it really you?

                           LOGAN
                     (not quite sure what sheÃ­s
                      talking about)
                 Yeah, itÃ­s really me.

                           CYCLOPS
                 Come on, letÃ­s get out of here.

       Logan stands.  He takes a couple of steps before
       collapsing in CyclopsÃ­ arms.

                           LOGAN
                     (sliding to the ground)
                 IÃ­m o.k.  IÃ­m o.k.

                           CYCLOPS
                 Sure you are, sport.

       EXT. LIBERTY ISLAND - DOCK - NIGHT

       Several Coast Guard cutters and police boats reach the
       island.  Men run across the dock as we pull up --

       EXT. LIBERTY ISLAND - NIGHT

       The Coast Guard, Secret Service, and FBI descend upon the
       island.

       INT. OLD TORCH ROOM - NIGHT

       Security enters the smoldering remains of the old torch
       room.  The walls blackened by a past inferno.  At the
       center, Pyro lies motionless in a sea of foam.

       INT. MUSEUM - NIGHT

       Push in on MYSTIQUE who is tied up.  Across her feet a
       crack of light as the door begins to open.  Swish pan
       over to the NYPD entering the room.  Swish pan back.
       Mystique has taken the form of a Secret Service agent.

                           AGENT/MYSTIQUE
                 Hey, could somebody untie me!

       EXT. SEAWALL - NIGHT

       A Secret Service spots the wreckage of MagnetoÃ­s boat and
       the large tarp which covers it.  He pulls his gun.

                           SECRET SERVICE MAN #3
                     (to other agents)
                 Hey!  Over here.

       Three other agents pull their guns and aim at the tarp.
       The first agent pulls it back to reveal... nothing.
       Sabretooth is gone.

       INT. STATUE - HEAD - NIGHT

       NYPD and Secret Service rush up the stairs and into the
       head.  Magneto lies unconscious on the floor.

       The lead guy, an NYPD OFFICER in a flak jacket, holding a
       shotgun, stares up at the ceiling.  He peers out through
       the gaping hole.  Beyond the damaged torch the star
       filled sky is momentarily eclipsed by a aircraft -- the X-
       Jet.

       The officer turns to say something, but stops --
       wondering if his eyes were merely playing tricks on him.

       INT. MANSION - DAY

       Cyclops, Jean, Storm, Rogue and about two dozen students
       all sit in front of a wide screen TV watching the Special
       Report on the Mutant Registration Act vote.

       As the Anchorman speaks we move over the concerned looks
       on all of their faces.

                           ANCHORMAN (O.S.)
                 Even after last weeks terrorist
                 vandalization of the Statue of Liberty
                 by an unidentified mutant
                 organization, the outcome of the vote
                 was 51 to 49 in opposition to the
                 Mutant Registration Act.

       A LOUD CHEER as the room erupts into celebration.

                           CYCLOPS
                 Quiet.  Quiet everybody.

                           ANCHORMAN
                 This narrow defeat was probably due in
                 large part to the surprising last-
                 minute reversal by Senator Scott
                 Ã¬FrankÃ® Kelly, who until today
                 provided the loudest voice in the cry
                 for Mutant Registration.  Earlier
                 today, Kelly had this to say:

       The TV cuts to a shot of Kelly being grilled by reporters
       as he walks down the Capitol steps.

                           KELLY
                     (struggling to get through)
                 If we can not go into the future
                 together, the divisions of fear and
                 prejudice will tear this country
                 apart.

       As he is speaking, we cut to:

       INT. CAPITOL BUILDING - WASHINGTON D.C. - DAY

       Kelly pushing past reporters.

                           KELLY
                 No more questions.  Please, no more
                 questions.

       E.C.U. The back of KellyÃ­s neck as he passes.  A BLUE
       SCALE is visible above his collar.

       INT. LOGANÃ­S ROOM - DAY

       The FAINT CHEERS are heard through the walls.

       HAZY THEN FOCUS INTO -- light pushes through blinds.  A
       gentle breeze moves them slightly.

       Logan sits up in his bed, his chest bandaged.

       VRRRIP -- the sound of blinds being pulled open.  Bright
       sunshine fills the room, washing across a box and a card
       sitting on a bureau.

       ANGLE ON: the card as Logan reads it.

       LOGAN -- WELCOME HOME.  It is signed simply, X.

       Logan reaches in the box, pulling out -- a UNIFORM.  He
       lays it on the bed.  He pulls on one of the gloves,
       stretching his fingers in it.  Perfect fit.

       SHOOK -- He pops his claws through THREE METAL RINGLETS
       on the back of the glove -- clearly it was made
       specifically for him.

       Logan looks down into the box for him.

       INT. LOGANÃ­S ROOM - LATER - DAY

       From behind Logan we see him finish putting something on
       over his head.  Logan turns into frame, he is wearing a
       dark blue MASK.

       It fits his head neatly.  The sides arch up shadowing his
       ears, giving him a wolf or fox-like appearance.  The
       shape is reminiscent of LoganÃ­s sketch -- the wolverine.

       Logan stands facing a mirror.  The mask looks good on him
       and he seems to know it.

       Xavier is in the doorway.

       Logan pulls off the mask, embarrassed.

                           LOGAN
                 DonÃ­t you knock?

                           XAVIER
                 TheyÃ­re all asking how youÃ­re doing.
                 Are you feeling up to saying hello to
                 everyone?

                           LOGAN
                     (pulling the glove off)
                 Actually IÃ­m feeling up to leaving.

       Logan walks over to the closet and pulls out a shirt.  He
       puts it on.

                           XAVIER
                     (surprised)
                 Why?  You have a home here now, if you
                 want it.  Everyone will...

                           LOGAN
                 What?... miss me?  Charley, IÃ­m gonna
                 walk out the front door and trust me,
                 it wonÃ­t be soon enough for everyone
                 here.

       Logan pulls a duffle bag out of the closet.

                           LOGAN (contÃ­d)
                 Can I, umm?

                           XAVIER
                 Of course.  Everything in this room is
                 for you.

       Logan seems genuinely touched by the gesture.

                           LOGAN
                 Thanks, IÃ­ll pay you back.

       Logan shoves some clothes into the bag, but not all.

                           XAVIER
                 Well if youÃ­re going to leave then you
                 at least owe them a goodbye.

       Logan smirks.  He picks up his bag.  They exit the room
       together.

       INT. MANSION - DAY

       The celebration continues unabated.  The newscaster on
       the defeat of the Mutant Registration Act muted, in the
       background -- Storm, Jean, and Cyclops all sit around a
       table chatting.  Rogue sits on the couch with other
       students, trying on a new pair of leather gloves.

                           XAVIER (O.S.)
                 Excuse me.
                     (louder)
                 Excuse me.

       Xavier is in the doorway.

                           XAVIER (contÃ­d)
                 Everyone, Logan would like to say...

       Logan steps into the doorway.  Everyone can see him now.
       Before Xavier can finish his sentence he is interrupted
       by --

       APPLAUSE -- simple, genuine, applause.

       Students slowly stand up.  Proud of Logan.  For he is one
       of them.  He is a mutant.  And he is a hero.

       As the unconditional applause echoes around him, Logan
       seems sincerely touched by their spontaneous outpouring.
       He is almost choked up -- almost.

       The applause quiet.

                           XAVIER (contÃ­d)
                 Well, Logan.

       All eyes are on Logan.  Logan pauses.  He looks to
       Xavier, then back to the room.

                           LOGAN
                 WhatÃ­s a guy gotta do to get a beer
                 around here?

       Logan puts his duffle bag down.  He walks over to the
       table with Storm, Cyclops and Jean.  Jean smiles at him,
       so does Cyclops -- his arm around the back of her chair.

       Logan sees them together, they are happy, and finally he
       offers a smile.

       Xavier holds for a moment at the door.  A look of pride
       on his face, the pride a father has for his children.

       INT. PLASTIC PRISON - DAY

       A CLEAR PLASTIC HALLWAY

       ThatÃ­s right, PLASTIC.  Everything we can see -- walls,
       ceiling, floor -- is made, entirely, of thick, clear
       plastic.

       DOWN THE HALL TO:

       A THICK PLASTIC CELL

       There, in the middle, at the clear plastic desk, with two
       clear plastic cups filled with the only thing of color
       other than the two men in the room.

       Xavier and Magneto.

       They play a friendly game of chess.

       Magneto is notably without his trademark helmet.  Two
       casts encase his legs from his Logan-inflicted injury.

       Xavier is on a modified plastic chair with plastic
       wheels.

                           MAGNETO
                 I wouldnÃ­t really have let you die,
                 you know.  I just needed...

                           XAVIER
                     (interrupting)
                 I know.

       Magneto thinks for a while; then:

                           MAGNETO
                 DoesnÃ­t it ever wake you in the middle
                 of the night?  The feeling that some
                 day, some day very soon, they will
                 pass that foolish law - or one just
                 like it - and they will come for you
                 and your children?  Take you all away?

                           XAVIER
                 It does indeed, Max.

                           MAGNETO
                 And what do you do when you wake up to
                 that?

                           XAVIER
                 I feel a great swell of pity for the
                 poor soul who comes to that school
                 again looking for trouble.

       He stares right at Magneto.

       Xavier makes a move, Magneto counters.  Xavier moves
       again.

                           MAGNETO
                 But you know that it is a war, old
                 friend.  And to win a war it takes the
                 will to fight it at all costs, by any
                 means necessary.  And for that reason,
                 I will always have the advantage.  No
                 matter how you trap me, how I am
                 contained -

       Chess pieces seem to visually mimic their conversation
       XavierÃ­s white pieces slowly surrounding MagnetoÃ­s Black
       King.

                           MAGNETO (contÃ­d)
                 - I will always find an escape.

                           XAVIER
                 And I will always be there, old
                 friend.

       And with that, Xavier places his queen gently down,
       taking away a knight.

                           XAVIER (contÃ­d)
                 Check.

       Just then, the door to the cell opens.  A Guard waits.

       Magneto and Xavier stare at one another before Xavier
       turns and wheels himself out of the room.

       The door closes behind him, leaving Magneto alone with
       his plastic chess set in his plastic cell.

       And Magneto looks at the pieces before him.  Something
       occurs to him.  He smiles a wicked smile.

       And his rook LEVITATES, despite its properties, moving
       across the board and toppling XavierÃ­s king.

                           MAGNETO
                 And mate.

       BLACK

		  EXT. A VACANT LOT -- NIGHT
                         
          Colored light from the billboard flickers over a bullet
          riddled sign: ROUTE 85. U.S. BORDER, EL PASO, TEXAS.
                         
          Beneath the sign is a LONG BLACK LIMOUSINE.
                         
          Cars whip past on the highway. Then A VAN passes, blasting
          some future version of Techno Latino Hip Hop. A SQUEAL OF
          TIRES OS. Now the music gets louder as the van returns,
          cruising slowly past the black limo before pulling into the
          lot. Five Bangers bail out and check out the black stretch.
                         
          The limo doors are locked, windows tinted, so they can't see
          what's inside, but they check out the tires and wheels and
          like what they see. With the speed of a pit crew, they open
          the back of the van and out come TOOLS AND A JACK.
                         
          INT. LIMO -- SAME
                         
          We move over the back bench, past empty bottles, fast food
          wrappers as A SLEEPING MAN'S FACE ratchets into frame.
          He opens his red eyes.
                         
          The man is LOGAN aka The Wolverine or more accurately, Drunk
          Wolverine. He blinks, dazed, feeling the car lurching upward.
          Older than we've seen him, he clutches a Tequila bottle.
                         
          EXT. LIMO -- EL PASO HIGHWAY TURNOUT - NIGHT
                         
          As the back door opens, the tequila bottle drops to the dirt
          and A BOOTED LEG STEPS OUT.
                         
          Logan shuffles, stiff, to the other side of the stretch where
          the Bangers work, removing wheels, lit by colored light.
                         
                                             LOGAN
                    ...Uh. Please stop, guys. Those,..
                    those are chrome plated lugs.
                         
          They all five turn. Some pull guns on the drunk limo driver.
          He just keeps talking, slurring some...
                         
                                             LOGAN (CONT'D)
                    you're gonna strip `em. Plating

          A Jittery Banger cocks his shotgun.
          Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                  2.
                         
                         
                                               LOGAN (CONT'D)
                      It's a lease, you know, and no one
                      wants to pay to ride in a--
                         
            -- THE JITTERY BANGER FIRES. Blows Logan right off his feet.
                         
                                                LOGAN (CONT'D)
                      Fuck.
                         
            Now might be a good time to talk about "fights" described in
            the next 100 or so pages. Basically, if you're on the make
            for a hyper choreographed, gravity defying, city-block
            destroying, CG fuckathon, this ain't your movie.
                         
            In this flick, people will get hurt or killed when shit falls
            on them. They will get just as hurt or just as killed if they
            get hit with something big and heavy like, say, a car. Should
            anyone in our story have the misfortune to fall off a roof or
            out a window, they won't bounce. They will die.
                         
            As for our hero with his so-called eternal life and healing.
            Well, he's older now. If you keep reading, you'll discover
            Logan's about to get his ass kicked. But before we get to
            that, we should make it clear his abilities ain't what they
            were. Yes, he's a drunk, but he's also fading on the inside.
            Adamantium implants leeching into his system, causing chronic
            pain and diminished healing, hence booze as painkiller.
                         
            So by all means, go ahead and worry about him.
            Now where were we? Oh, yeah--
                         
            As the smoke settles, a CROWBAR-toting Banger angrily chews
            out Jitters in Spanish for firing. The others resume their
            work... none aware of Logan slowly getting up, till --
                         
                                                LOGAN (CONT'D)
                      Guys... seriously...
                          (gets to his feet)
                      You don't wanna do this.
                         
            The Bangers react to Logan with bafflement. Ad-lib Spanish
            reactions, nervous chuckles --
                         
            CROWBAR presses down JITTER'S gun as he moves to Logan.
                         
            We hear a familiar SNIKT! as claws slowly extend from one of
            Logan's hands, then mostly extend from the other. Logan is
            still frowning at his bad hand when--
                         
            CROWBAR THWACKS HIS SKULL. A metallic ring.
                         
            Off balance and pissed, Logan swings at them as they
            converge, but he's drunk and soon they are pounding him with
            knives and guns and fists and a torque wrench.
          Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                    3.
                         
                         
            He tries his best to keep them from the limo, catches one
            guy's bat an inch before it would dent the car.
                         
            Another one of them shoots in that direction, but Logan puts
            himself in front of the bullet. The pain from that little
            move stops him long enough for them to resume the pummeling.
                         
            Suddenly, Logan's eyes go yellow, pupils dilating. He lets
            out a long, loud yell. Fury rockets up in him, like cocaine.
                         
            HE STANDS AND RAMS HIS CLAWS INTO CROWBAR and kicks another
            Banger into the back of the open van. Yet another runs at
            Logan only to get gored in the neck and tossed. This is real
            work for Logan, not easy. And it is fueled by rage.
                         
            Jitters again raises his sawed-off, he will nail the car for
            sure, but Logan slices off his arm above the elbow.
                         
            Sadly for Logan, the hand, while disconnected from the body
            it once belonged to, is still holding the gun. So, as it hits
            the dirt, the gun goes off, putting several pellet-sized
            holes in the door of the limo.
                         
            This, more than anything else, doubles Logan anger--
                         
                                                 LOGAN (CONT'D)
                                     MOTHERF--
                         
            WHO GETS HIT ONCE MORE --and then goes after the last banger
            who, seeing he had his chance, leaps into the van and spins
            out of the lot, his wounded compadre in back, spilling onto
            the dirt as the van bounces back onto the road.
                         
            Logan picks up his keys, some loose change and a single
            silver bullet. He stands, staring at the holes in his
            otherwise pristine stretch as RAIN BEGINS TO FALL.
                         
            He sucks in deep breaths, forcing himself to regain control.
            His eyes return to normalcy. A PHONE VIBRATES OS. Logan takes
            out his, looks at it (he's got a fare), kicks the jack from
            the under the chassis.
                         
            WE CRANE UP as Logan starts up the stretch and makes a loop
            in the lot, taking care to run over the three remaining
            Bangers before laying rubber onto the highway...

            LOGAN cruises the wet El Paso streets. LCD Billboards for
            chemically enhanced life. Gang graffiti on self-driving
            buses. A kaleidoscope of moments, dark and mundane.

                       Clyde, its 2026! We're talkin `bout
                       a hostage crisis and you're talkin'

                       in Galveston, you're on!
                         
            A beat throbs through the partition. Logan's eyes flick to--
                         
            FOUR INEBRIATED PROM BOYS in back, in pastel tuxes. Three of
            them stand on the bench looking out the sunroof. They howl
            and shout, "rapping" with the now blasting music, waving to
            rain-soaked Hispanics at a HEAVILY GUARDED BORDER GATE.
                         
            CLOSE-- LOGAN as he endures the torture, jaw clenched, brake

            EXT. EL PASO GAS STATION -- EARLIER
                         
            Wet and bullet-riddled from the altercation with the Bangers,
            Logan grabs a "back-up" suit from the trunk. He holds it up,
            not in the best shape, but will have to do.
                         
            BACK TO:   INT./EXT. LIMO -- PROM CAR -- EL PASO STREETS
                         
            THE PROM TEENS in the back suck vape sticks and laugh. Two
            get it on. One pitches forward and yells over the music.
                         
                                                TEEN
                       Yo, Driver, you got any Bang in
                       this whip?!
                         
            Logan pretends he can't hear. Instead, his gaze shifts to his
            passenger visor, and what's tucked there:
                         
            A PAGE FROM A SPANISH PENNY SAVER -- a USED 70 FT. SUNSEEKER
            docked in the Gulf of Mexico, LA SERENATA painted on its
            transom. Scrawled below: "Asking $60K."
                         
            Logan stares hard at the image of the boat. Takes a centering
            breath -- when the TEEN BEGINS KNOCKING on the partition.

            Logan cleans up at the sink. Allows a couple slugs to pop
            from his (slowly healing) wounds as he changes into a clean
            suit. Looks at himself in the mirror. HIS PHONE BUZZES.
                         
                                               LOGAN

            Logan waits with other drivers as muffled off screen
            "hallelujahs!" ring out O.S. He looks at a large screen TV
            where the crowd can be seen, hands raised, praising God.
            Everywhere are similar words in a "trademarked" design--
                         
            "You are God's plan!" "We are God's plan!"
            "Be Part of God's plan!" "His plan!"
                         
            Then Logan notices, across the street--
                         
            A FIAT WITH MEXICAN PLATES AND A BAD HEADLIGHT DOUBLE PARKED.
            The driver, a Woman inside watching him. A child in back in a
            red jacket watches him too.

            AN OLD LADY and her HUSBAND, both in failing health, ride,
            clinging to "God's Plan" Merchandise. The Old Lady looks out
            the window at the lost souls on the street.
                         
                                               OLD LADY
                      Shouldn't we lock the doors?

                      They're locked, ma'am.
                         
            Logan watches as her husband takes her hand. Then, Logan
            notices-- THE FIAT WITH MEXICAN PLATES. He makes a quick
            turn, the old folks sliding to one side. He's lost them.
                         
            EXT. EL PASO CEMETERY GROUNDS - DAWN

            Returning to his limo, Logan watches THE BEREAVED FAMILY,
            drawn in spite of himself: how they mourn the loss of their
            own, how they console each other--

                      Logan.
                         
            He turns to face A DISHEVELED HISPANIC WOMAN, 35. She stands
            about twenty paces from THE BATTERED FIAT WITH ONE HEADLIGHT,
            wipers on. Logan eyes the woman, wild-eyed, dirty raincoat,
            gets a big whiff of "crazy."
                         
                                               HISPANIC WOMAN
                      ...I knew it was you.
                         
            Logan moves past her, heads for his limo in line with others.
                         
                                HISPANIC WOMAN (CONT'D)
                      Please. I'm in trouble. You're the
                      only one who can help.
                         
            Logan looks at her as THE MOURNERS (his clients) come down
            the hill toward the line of black vehicles.
                         
                                HISPANIC WOMAN (CONT'D)
                      I need a hero.
                         
            Logan laughs as he pulls an umbrella from his trunk.
                         
                                               LOGAN
                      Don't we all.
                         
            He turns to his clients, holding the umbrella over a sobbing
            widow, escorting her to the door of his limo. The Hispanic
            woman just stands there, rain soaking her.

                      What are you hiding from?!
                         
            As Logan falls behind the wheel, he checks his clients in the
            rear view and that's when there is a sudden screech--
                         
            THE FIAT makes a fast U-turn, nearly sideswiping him. And as
            it swerves away, Logan glimpses THE FIGURE in the back
            window. THE DARK-HAIRED GIRL IN A RED SLICKER, face a blur.

            EMERGENCY ROOM ENTRANCE. He hurries through the rain, meeting
            A LARGE MAN IN ORDERLY SCRUBS, smoking a vape under a canopy.
          Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                    7.
                         
                         
            The two talk for a moment, Logan hands the man cash and the
            man toys with handing Logan a bag, pulls it away, demanding
            more money. They argue.
                         
            REVERSE TO REVEAL-- A MAN IN A JEEP, WATCHING through the
            rain, HIS METAL HAND ON THE WHEEL.
                         
            INT. LOGAN'S LIMO -- OUTSIDE HOSPITAL -- MOMENTS LATER
                         
            Logan, now carrying the bag, hurries through the rain to his
            Limo. He climbs inside starts it up but is startled by the
            back door opening and closing. Logan spins to face --
                         
            A SMILING MAN in the back of his stretch. This is Donald
            Pierce, 35. A southern boy, smooth and playful.
                         
                                               PIERCE
                      As I live and breathe. The
                      Wolverine. And he's a junkie now.
                         
                                               LOGAN
                      Who the fuck are you?
                         
                                                PIERCE
                      Y'know, you got some buckshot in
                      your door.
                          (plays with the liquor
                           bottles in back)
                      I heard you were in Phoenix.
                      Food's better there by the way. But
                      then, last night, some friends in
                      Texas H-P called, told me they
                      found three dead cholos in a
                      pullout out on 54. Not unusual,
                      except one was missing a hand.
                      Another a leg. Multiple parallel
                      lacerations. Slashes, femoral,
                      thoracic. So, they're thinking it
                      was either an escaped Tiger or
                      Freddy Krueger... but neither of
                      those can drive, one being
                      fictional the other extinct. And
                      since the wheel lugs they found
                      belong to a `24 Gauntlet--
                         
                                               LOGAN

                                                PIERCE
                      Has she found you yet? ...Gabriela?
                          (off Logan's blank look)
                      See, I'm not looking for you,
                      mutey. Not really. I'm looking for
                      someone who's looking for you.

                      She took something of mine.
                      Something for which I am
                      responsible. When I wasn't looking.
                      Mexican lady. Long hair, long legs,
                      Long gone. Has her sights on you.
                          (off Logan's glare)
                      No bells?
                         
                                               LOGAN
                      I don't know any Gabriela.
                      So get the fuck out.
                         
            Pierce just smiles, unfazed, then shifts his gaze to Logan's
            bag of pills. Peering in, quasi-conspiratorial:
                         
                                               PIERCE
                      I know what you're hiding, amigo.
                      Cue ball south of the border?
                         
            Logan tenses, says nothing.
                         
                                               LOGAN
                      What do you want?
                         
                                               PIERCE
                      A little ...cooperation.
                         
            Flicks a business card.
                         
                                               PIERCE (CONT'D)
                      If she does find you.
                         
            Then Pierce exits. Crosses in the rain to a Custom Ram Truck,
            Logan looks to the card:
                         
                          DONALD PIERCE -- CHIEF OF SECURITY

            EXT. CORDOVA BRIDGE - BORDER - MORNING
                         
            A HUGE FUCKING WALL. "YOU ARE NOW LEAVING THE UNITED STATES"
            says the sign mounted on top of it. Brown muted light pushes
            through the haze over the factories on the Mexican side.
                         
            An agitated Logan in border traffic, talking on his phone as
            he eyes the CAMERAS watching him:
                         
                                                LOGAN
                      Mr. Espiranza, yes, I know I said
                      June, but I want the boat now. Yes.
                      Why does that mean the price go up?

                      Yes, I know you wanted seventy, but
                      I am telling you I have 45 cash
                      now. Just bring it to port in Baja.
                         
            The seller HANGS UP. Logan sighs. Logan squints at the Penny
            Saver on his seat, a listing for a Sunseeker circled when a
            CAR HORN blares. Logan inches forward moving past--
                         
            A semi pulling A LIVESTOCK TRAILER loaded with sad looking
            horses. EL RIO MEATS painted on the side.
                         
            A BORDER AGENT nods cheerfully at Logan, recognizing him.
            Waves him on. And that's when we see --
                         
            THE WOMAN FROM THE CEMETERY (GABRIELA) WATCHING HIM FROM
            BEHIND THE WHEEL OF HER FIAT. At a distance. She considers
            following him, then swings her car around.
                         
            EXT. CIUDAD JUAREZ - HIGHWAY 45 -- MORNING
                         
            Logan drives through littered Mexican streets. Cinderblock
            structures pocked with bullet holes, metal shutters pulled.
                         
            He merges onto Highway 45, heading for the desert.
                         
            EXT. ABANDONED SMELTING PLANT - DAY
                         
            A vista of dirt, bisected by train tracks and fence. Logan
            slows as he approaches A GATE. Beyond the gate, AN ABANDONED
            SMELTING PLANT. Logan exits, pulls keys, unlocks the gate.
                         
            A CART WITH A PROPANE TANK STOPS as the limo comes up the
            road. Camera reveals the cart is pushed by A TALL MAN in a
            wide hat, sunglasses and gloves. He wipes his ghost-pale
            brow. This is CALIBAN, an albino mutant in his 60's with more
            than a passing resemblance to Edvard Munch's THE SCREAM.
                         
            INT. SMELTING PLANT -- "KITCHEN" - DAY
                         
            THE WINDOWS ARE PAPERED TO KEEP OUT SUNLIGHT. Caliban,
            glasses, hat and gloves off, prepares a tray of food as Logan
            enters. From somewhere, the sound of AN OLD MAN SHOUTING.
                         
                                               CALIBAN

            Logan tosses Caliban the bag. He peers in. Logan crosses to
            find something to eat.

                      won't last through the week.

            Logan sighs and crosses toward a cabinet.
                         
                                               CALIBAN (CONT'D)
                      You know, he told me last night

            Caliban follows. The old man's voice getting louder.

                      Don't be so sure. He had all these
                      details. I thought that tank was
                      supposed to provide some sort of
                      barrier. It's got all these cracks
                      in it. What good is that?

            Moving down a corridor, Logan opens a cabinet beside AN
            EXTERIOR DOOR. Pulls out a box of SYRINGE KITS and restocks
            the pills and a vial of liquid from the bag. Loads a syringe.

            Logan swings open the door and Caliban dodges the sudden
            blast of sunlight as--
                         
            EXT. ABANDONED SMELTING PLANT -- DAY
                         
            Logan crosses beneath a catwalk toward A HUGE ROUND PLATED
            TANK pitched over on its side. The old man's voice getting
            louder. He spins open the hatch and steps inside--

            INT. HUGE PLATED TANK -- CONTINUOUS
                         
            Logan enters the space and find himself facing, AN OLD MAN IN
            A WHEELCHAIR making circles around mattress. CHARLES XAVIER
            in his 90s. Bearded, tufts of white on his pate. A small
            radio plays music with alligator clips to a car battery.
                         
                                               CHARLES
                      Friends, I have Good News today!
                      It's not about what you do. It's
                      not about your deeds. You can't
                      live up to his rules. God knows you
                      can't. That's OK! We're imperfect!
                         
            Logan steps over a dumped tray of food, approaches Charles
            with the meds. Charles swings his chair around him.
                         
                                               CHARLES (CONT'D)

            Logan steps into his path and Charles stops.
                         
                                               CHARLES (CONT'D)

                                                LOGAN
                      No.
                         
                                                CHARLES
                      The new Quesalupa from Taco Bell.
                      Get it with chicken, get it with
                      steak. But with cheese baked right
                      in the shell it's the next big--
                                         (BEAT)
                      Who are you?
                         
                                               LOGAN
                      You know who I am.
                         
                                                CHARLES
                          (sees the syringe)
                      The man who puts me to sleep.
                         
                                               LOGAN
                      We could both use some sleep.
                         
            Logan proceeds to roll up Charles' sleeve, but Charles
            resists and they struggle for control of the needle--
                         
                                               LOGAN (CONT'D)
                      Charles, you're making this--
          Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                12.
                         
                         
            Charles lunges for the needle and as Logan pulls it away,
            CHARLES FALLS OUT OF THE CHAIR to the floor. He looks up at
            Logan, enraged. A RINGING SOUND begins to rise...
                         
                                               CHARLES
                      What are you fucking doing to me!?
                         
            A tremor suddenly shakes Charles' body. And now Logan is hit
            with a PSIONIC BLAST. THE RINGING LOUD AND UNBEARABLE, like a
            fork scraping his brain. Charles eyes are now blood red.
                         
            EXT. SMELTING PLANT FUEL TANK - DAY
                         
            Caliban, headed back to the kitchen, suddenly fights a kind
            of induced paralysis, struggling to move, breathe--
                         
            INT. SMELTING PLANT FUEL TANK - DAY
                         
            Logan, pushing through the pain, pulls out the syringe and
            INJECTS Charles. The medication immediately takes effect,
            subduing the wave.
                         
            EXT. SMELTING PLANT FUEL TANK - DAY
                         
            Caliban is released as well, gulping for air.
                         
            INT. SMELTING PLANT FUEL TANK - DAY
                         
            Charles lies still, staring up at Logan who shakes off the
            effects of the wave, the ringing fading. He reaches down and
            picks up the disoriented old man--
                         
                                               CHARLES
                      How long have I been here?
                         
            Logan carries him to the bed and sets him down. Charles looks
            around, in tears. Logan doesn't answer, dumps two pills into
            his palm which he transfers to Charles' hand.
                         
                                               CHARLES (CONT'D)
                      What are these?
                         
                                               LOGAN
                      You remember what they are. The
                      shots mellow the seizures, the
                      pills keep them from happening.
                         
            Charles stares at the pills.
                         
                                                LOGAN (CONT'D)
                      How `bout you blow on them to make
                      them safe.
                         
            Charles looks up at Logan.
          Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                13.
                         
                         
                                               CHARLES
                      Fuck off, Logan.

                      So you know who I am now.
                         
                                               CHARLES
                      I always know who you are.
                      Sometimes I just don't recognize you.
                         
                                               LOGAN
                      Take the pills.
                         
            Charles pops them in his mouth, swallows them. Logan starts
            to clean up the spilled dinner.
                         
                                                CHARLES

                      fucking Albino... he won't listen
                      to me. I know a damn speciation

                                                CHARLES

                      Too bad you're not in that business
                      anymore.
                         
                                                CHARLES
                      They want your help, not mine.
                          (off Logan's look)
                      Oh, yes. That's how fucking stupid
                      they are. They're waiting for you.
                      At the Statue of Liberty.

                      The Statue of Liberty was a long
                      time ago, Charles. A long time.
                         
            Logan crosses to the old man. Takes in the worry on his face.

                      years. Not anywhere.

            Charles looks off. The drugs mercifully tugging at him.
                         
                                               CHARLES
                      Impossible.
                         
            Logan pulls the quilt over the old man.
                         
                                               LOGAN
                      You always thought we were part of
                      God's Plan. Maybe we were just
                      God's mistake.
                         
            Charles touches Logan's face. A tender moment until--
                         
                                               CHARLES
                      What a disappointment you are.
                         
            Logan takes this in. Stung.
                         
                                               CHARLES (CONT'D)
                      When I found you, you were pursuing

                      You were an animal, but we took you

            Logan eyes him a hard beat, then turns to go.

            But Logan ignores him, moving for the hatch.

            Logan spins the hatch wheel, entombing the old man.
            He walks away as the yelling continues.

            A SERIES OF SHOTS-- Logan on his back, unable to sleep, the
            sun hitting his face through a soot covered window as he
            stares hard at the Penny Saver boat listings: La Serenata.
                         
            He tosses the Pennysaver. Paces like a panther. Shirtless,
            scarred. He stops, looks at his right hand, flexes it, stiff,
            arthritic, knuckles swollen, the slits moist.
                         
            He forces his claws out. They come slow. Painfully. Middle
            one lagging. He grabs the middle claw with his other hand and
            pulls it hard, slicing into his palm, blood flowing.

            Stumbling in fading light, his palm wrapped with a rag, Logan
            drinks from a bottle and stares at the fading light as he
            hears Charles calling his name in the great pitched tank.

            Logan dresses in his chauffeur blacks. His hand shakes making

                      Well. Would it be considered
                      nagging if repeated my observation

                      A year ago, you asked me to help

            they start to stumble out pushing tips as him. That's when--
                         
            HIS PHONE BUZZES-- Logan squints at what looks like a new
            fare as the last bridesmaid exits. He reaches in his coat and
            pulls out READING GLASSES (A Walgreens tag still on them.)

            Logan pulls his limo into a lot fronting a small twentieth
            century motel next to the freeway. 3300 Marquez. A neon
            STATUE OF LIBERTY looms overhead.
                         
            Logan gets out of the car and takes in the sign.
                         
            He looks to the OFFICE and sees A WOMAN, (THE MANAGER) a big
            lady, tinted hair, thinning, in flip flops, smoking a vape.
            Logan hears a BOUNCE BOUNCE BOUNCE and turns to see...
                         
            THE GIRL IN THE RAIN SLICKER.
                         
            As he walks into the courtyard, he can see that she is brown
            skinned, dark-eyed, staring at him, standing by THE FIAT WITH
            THE BROKEN LIGHT, calmly bouncing a ball. Once in a while she
            bounces it off the side of the motel, catching it crisply.

            The MOTEL MANAGER flees to her office.
                         
                                                GABRIELA
                          (panicked, terrified)
                      Don't let her call anyone. They
                      will find us. They will kill us.
                         
            INT. LIBERTY MOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT
                         
            Logan helps Gabriela to the bed. He takes in the mess of
            files, print outs, clippings, toys. He notices a medical kit.
            Cracks it open, fully stocked, looks at Gabriela.
                         
                                                GABRIELA
                      I`m a nurse.
                                         (THEN)
                      Was. In Mexico City.
                         
            Logan watches as Gabriela lifts her sleeve, takes things from
            the kit, ministering to her wound.
                         
                                               LOGAN
                      When did that happen?

                      This morning. Near the border. I
                      got away from them. But they know
                      my car now.
                         
            She reaches for the NIGHT STAND, pries open its cheap side
            paneling, and pulls out a bloody envelope hidden there. Hands
            it to Logan. There's an address on the outside and a set of
            numbers beneath it. Inside, bundles of greenbacks.

                      My boyfriend. He wants to kill me.
                      And take her.
                         
            He eyes the girl standing in the door.

            Gabriela and the girl exchange looks.
                         
                                                GABRIELA

                      He wants to hurt her.
                          (takes Logan's hand)
                      I know you are still good inside.
                      I know you want to help.
                          (looks in his eyes)
                      Please. There won't be any
                      problems. Not if we leave now.

                      We have to be there Friday.

                                                GABRIELA
                      Or we miss our chance. To cross.
                          (a coughing fit, then)
                      Our... family. They will be there
                      that day. No other day.
                         
            Logan glances at the girl and back to Gabriela. The money in
            his hand. Enough to buy the boat.

                      I can get you there Friday. But I
                      need to go home first, take care of
                      some things.
                         
                                               GABRIELA
                      Bring us with you. Please. We can
                      help with whatever you need to do.
                         
            Logan moves to the door. Gabriela sobs, closes her eyes.
                         
                                                LOGAN
                      I'll be back in a few hours.
                          (looks at the girl)
                      Keep this locked. And tell your
                      mommy I know she's lying.
                         
            Logan exits and we move CLOSE ON-- THE GIRL. She crosses to
            the window, looking out like a sentinel, as Logan's limo
            drives away.
                         
            EXT. ABANDONED SMELTING PLANT -- NIGHT
                         
            Logan pulls in. The trunk pops open and Logan walks around
            and grabs several bags from the back. Then slams it closed.
                         
            INT. SMELTING PLANT -- KITCHEN -- NIGHT
                         
            As Caliban goes through all of the GROCERIES Logan has
            brought. Steaks. Ice Cream. Cereal. Bourbon.
                         
                                               CALIBAN
                      Tell me you didn't rob a bank.
                         
            Logan tosses him a white paper bag. Caliban looks inside--
            it's stuffed full of meds.
                         
                                               CALIBAN (CONT'D)
                      So you did rob a bank.

                      I got a job that's gonna pay enough
                      to change things. But I have to go
                      away. For a week.
                         
            Caliban takes this in, watches as Logan opens a Tequila
            bottle and continue out the door.

            Caliban pokes his head out into the desert night, watching
            Logan heading toward Charles' tank.

            INT. SMELTING PLANT FUEL TANK -- MOMENTS LATER
                         
            Logan finishes giving Charles his pills, lays him down on his
            bed. Charles is a bit dazed. Logan's phone buzzes. He pops on
            his new eyeglasses, looks down at it.
                         
            THE TEXT READS -- "Please hurry."
                         
                                               CHARLES
                      I like those. They make you look
                      younger.
                         
            Logan types back, "On my way."
            Caliban arrives in the hatchway, watching.

                      And... you'll be safe there? From
                      the people after you?
                         
            Logan meets Charles' eyes. He looks to Caliban in the door.
                         
                                               LOGAN
                      Yeah. I'll be safe.
                         
            Charles looks up at him, pleased. Logan considers his old
            friend, then heads for the hatch, moving past Caliban.
                         
            EXT. LIBERTY MOTEL ALLEY AND ROAD -- DAWN
                         
            Logan pulls into the lot. Everything peaceful and wet. A TV
            glows in the manager's office. Logan crosses to the door to
            Gabriela's room. He knocks.

            around the doorjamb. He pushes the door open...

            INT. LIBERTY MOTEL ROOM - MORNING
                         
            The room has been trashed. Blood everywhere. The bed is
            empty. Gabriela is tied to a chair, eyes unblinking, face
            blue, body riddled with bullets and cuts.

                      ...Fuck.
                         
            Logan makes a sweep of the room. Then recalls --
                         
            The NIGHT STAND. Pries the side panel free. There, wedged in
            the gap-- A PHONE IN A PINK CASE. He takes it.
                         
            Sees her last text was to him. "Please hurry..."
            He pockets the phone.
                         
            EXT. LIBERTY MOTEL - MORNING - RAIN
                         
            Logan closes the door behind him and steps into the rain,
            scanning the lot. No sign of the girl anywhere.
                         
            He looks down, noticing gouges on the concrete, slashes,
            filling with rain and blood. Then he spots --
                         
            A BLOODY CYBORG FINGER on the pavement. High Tech. Severed at
            the knuckle, wires trailing. He picks it up. The fuck?
                         
            SIRENS BEGINS TO RISE. He quickly crosses to his car, now
            noticing the MOTEL MANAGER DEAD BY THE VENDING MACHINES.

            Logan barrels through the gate and screeches to a stop.
            Gets out and heads for the small structure behind the tank
            that contains his bedroom--

            Caliban rounds the corner in his big hat and goggles,
            approaching from his "garden" with a bunch of beets. Logan
            starts to climb the steps but turns as Caliban follows.

            Caliban turns away with a sigh, heading to the main building.

            This is when Logan pauses and comes back down the steps
            looking out to his limo, TRUNK OPEN, Caliban approaching it.
                         
            EXT. SMELTING PLANT -- A MOMENT LATER
                         
            Caliban reaches, ABOUT TO SHUT THE TRUNK-- WHEN LOGAN'S HAND
            STOPS HIM. Logan peers inside.
                         
            A CHILD'S BACKPACK. He grabs it. Unzips it. MEDICAL FILES.
            COMIC BOOKS. A PLASTIC HORSE. Other trinkets. Then he notices
            something in the trunk bed. A RUBBER BALL. The girl's ball.
                         
                                               CALIBAN
                      ...Who does that belong to?
                         
            That's when Logan hears a sound and looks to-- A JEEP
            APPROACHING ON THE HORIZON. Pierce's Jeep.
                         
                                               CALIBAN (CONT'D)

                      Go. Inside.
                         
            Caliban shuffles away as--
                         
            Logan watches the JEEP TURN ONTO THE GROUNDS and come to a
            stop in a dust cloud. Donald Pierce climbs out in a
            windbreaker. He approaches, taking in the property.

            The man takes a step closer and Logan grabs him by the arm.
            Feels something there and looks at the man who smiles...
            PIERCE HAS A CYBORG ARM. Ending in a gleaming, metal hand. A

            Logan turns, stunned to see--
                         
            THE GIRL standing by an out-building.

            She looks at Logan, THEN SUDDENLY WINGS ANOTHER PIPE AT HIM.
            Logan watches it come and CATCHES IT, about to wing it back
                           WHEN--

            The girl (LAURA) crosses, snatches her backpack from Logan,
            then steps over Pierce and crosses to Charles.
                         
            Bewildered, Logan kneels pulls a GUN from Pierce's waistband.
            He hands it to Caliban who lands beside him, taking in the
            cyborg hand and the tattoo on Pierce's neck.

            Logan eyes LAURA'S BACKPACK which she keeps close. He grabs
            it but Laura stands, holding the strap. Logan shoves her

                      Take them-- Now.
                          (goes back to packing)
                      We have to go. Leave. It isn't safe
                      here anymore. And you can't have an
                      attack out there. Understand?
                         
                                                CHARLES
                          (swallows the pills)
                      She's the mutant I told you about.
                      The one we have to help.

                      She's not a mutant.
                         
                                               CHARLES
                      Yes, she is.

                          (crossing to a duffel)
                      What's her gift, eating? Pipe
                      throwing?
                         
            Logan is interrupted by A LOUD RUMBLE AS THE NIGHTLY FREIGHT
            TRAIN APPROACHES. Laura bolts up from the table. Charles
            reaches out for her...
                         
                                               CHARLES
                      It's alright, Laura. It's only a
                      train. A choo choo.
                         
            He nods to the monitor. We see the FREIGHT TRAIN passing in
            the distance. She stares at it. Like she's never seen one.

            Caliban at the wheel, in gloves and sun hat. The gun Logan
            gave him on the dash. He pulls to a stop.
                         
            INT./EXT. CALIBAN'S CAR - MEXICAN ROAD - DAY
                         
            Caliban drags an unconscious Pierce out of the car. He moves
            to exit, crosses to close the jeep's rear hatch when he HEARS
            A SOFT RUMBLE. He looks off and sees...
                         
            ALL TERRAIN VEHICLES IN THE DISTANCE. Lots of them.
                         
            Caliban turns back to see Pierce standing by the driver door.
            Grinning... He reaches for the gun on the dash and cocks it.
                         
                                               PIERCE

            As Logan shoves the last of the packed bags, and whatever
            else he's grabbed, into the trunk. THE SAME RUMBLE. He looks
            up at -- a cloud of silt rising on the horizon.

                          (coming in the door)
                      --it's not a train. We gotta go!
                         
            Out the window, FOUR BLACK FEDERALE TRUCKS approach in a
            cloud of dust. Armed men in black hang onto the vehicles.
            Behind the trucks, THE SAME FOUR LARGE CUSTOM ALL TERRAIN
            VEHICLES. A different type of men are on board these,
            mercenaries, in full tactical gear.
                         
            NOTE -- We'll call the mercenaries riding   behind the
            Federales, THE REAVERS. They outclass the   Federales with
            their weapons, vehicles, armor and skill.   Many have
            weaponized appendages where missing limbs   should be.
                         
            Logan takes hold of Charles' wheelchair, pushing him to the
            door. He passes Laura, points at her, an order:
                         
                                               LOGAN (CONT'D)

                                                CHARLES
                          (as he wheels out)
                      Don't be afraid, child.
                      He'll come back for you!
                         
            She looks at Logan, not so sure.

            Logan wheels a bouncing Charles rapidly out the door over the
            gravel and rocks toward the limo.
                         
                                               CHARLES
                      ...bloody hell.
                         
            THE RUMBLE GETS LOUDER and Logan and Charles look up as-- THE
            VEHICLES SMASH THROUGH THE GATE.
                         
                                                 CHARLES (CONT'D)

            wheelchair in the trunk.
                         
                                                 CHARLES
                      Logan!
                         
            Logan quickly unzips his duffel, grabs something else. The
            Federales almost upon them. Charles yells at Logan as he
            slams the trunk and returns to Charles' door.

                      She's not our problem.
                         
            Logan grabs a seat belt and hurriedly straps Charles in...
            and doing so, surreptitiously pulls out a loaded hypodermic
            and jams it into the old man's (numb) thigh.
                         
                                               CHARLES
                      I know what you just did.
                         
            Logan jumps behind the wheel, turns it over, hits the gas--
                         
                                                CHARLES (CONT'D)
                      LOGAN!
                         
            From the opposite direction, THREE MORE TRUCKS LOADED WITH
            FEDERALES and FOUR MERCENARIES ON DIRT BIKES, BLOCK THEM.
                         
            Logan stomps on the brakes and SLIDES TO A STOP.
                         
            A door opens and Donald Pierce steps out of his truck, his
            suit now dusted from his earlier misadventure. Around him,
            FEDERALES AND REAVERS ALL train their guns on the limo.
                         
            Jumping off one of the Federale Jeeps, A MEXICAN COMMANDER,
            chest decorated with mid-level brass, orders his men to take
            tactical positions surrounding the structures. He barks
            orders in Spanish and holds a police sketch of Laura.
                         
                                               FEDERALE COMMANDER

            Laura sits at the table. She refills her bowl with cereal and
            eats it methodically with her spoon, watching the stand-off
            outside through the windows like a TV show.

            Logan watches as Pierce walks toward their limo.   Charles
            getting fuzzier in back, the meds kicking in.

            Pierce arrives at the driver's side window, sees Charles in
            back, smiles down at the old man smiling back at him.
                         
                                               PIERCE
                      Ah, Charles Xavier. The most wanted
                      octogenarian in North America--
                         
            Logan shoves the door open into Pierce, knocking him back.
            THE SOUND OF MANY GUNS CLICKING AS THE FEDERALES TRAIN
            WEAPONS ON LOGAN. But Logan gets in Pierce's face, fiery:

                      Excuse me. I'm a nonagenarian,

                      How about you tell me where the
                      girl is first. Or maybe I ought to
                      ask the cue ball. Seems friendly.

                      I told you, she's not here.
                      Where's Caliban?!
                         
            Pierce smirks, amused by Logan's anger.
                         
                                               PIERCE
                      I left him in the same hole you
                      were going to leave me.
                         
            Logan loses it, lunges for him -- when someone hits Logan
            from behind. Hard. And again. As Logan falls to his knees and
            turns-- SNIKT-- AND SEPARATES A REAVER from his arm.

            THE FEDERALE COMMANDER nods.

            AND A SWARM OF FEDERALES ATTACK LOGAN WITH RIFLE BUTTS AND
            BOOTS AND BEAT HIM TO THE GROUND. There are too many.
                         
            Pummeled, overwhelmed, his limbs all pinned, Logan turns over
            to find PIERCE'S FOOT TO HIS THROAT. Pierce leans down.
                         
                                               PIERCE
                      Jesus. Seeing you this way,

                      As soon as I rip it out of your
                      chest, fuck-stick.
                         
            Pierce smiles, then nods to one of the Reavers (Mohawk) who
            jumps off his bike and advances toward a side door of the
            Smelting Plant. He's carrying a STEEL RESTRAINING COLLAR.
                         
            The Federale Commander shouts to Pierce.
                         
                                                FEDERALE COMMANDER
                                         (IN SPANISH)
                      No one goes in without Federale
                      escort. I am in charge.
                         
            Mohawk pauses. The Commander dispatches two of his Federales
            to lead him inside, weapons drawn.
                         
            INT. SMELTING PLANT KITCHEN - DAY
                         
            THE DOOR OPENS as MOHAWK AND THE TWO FEDERALES creep into the
            dark room adjacent to the kitchen, advancing toward--
                         
            Laura at the kitchen table, her back to them. She seems
            oblivious as she pours more cereal, eats with her spoon.
                         
            One of the Federales accidentally kicks a bottle and Laura
            pauses her spoon in the air.
                         
            EXT. ABANDONED SMELTING PLANT - DAY
                         
            ON LOGAN, watching. Charles, watching.
                         
            SUDDENLY, THERE ARE SCREAMS FROM INSIDE THE STRUCTURE. Men's
            screams. Then it is quiet. Everyone turns as --
                         
            Creeaaak. A STEEL DOOR OPENS WIDE. LAURA steps from the dark
            into the blazing light. She SQUINTS.
                         
            Pierce steps off Logan, having found his quarry.
                         
                                               PIERCE
                      That-a-girl.
          Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                   35.
                         
                         
            --and now LAURA BOOTS SOMETHING which rolls to Pierce's feet.
                         
            Pierce and the Federale Commander look down at--
            A SEVERED HEAD. WITH A MOHAWK.
                         
            THEN SHE TOSSES THE STEEL RESTRAINT COLLAR TO THE DIRT.
                         
                                                PIERCE (CONT'D)
                                         (SIGHS)
                      ...Laura.
                         
            ON LOGAN -- Pulling himself up from the ground as--
                         
            LAURA-- continues walking toward Pierce. Hands at her sides.
                         
                                               PIERCE (CONT'D)
                      Laura. Stay where you are. You want
                      to see your friends, right?
                         
            ON PIERCE-- as he nods to the REAVERS to prepare to take her.
                         
            A CYBORG-LEGGED REAVER OPENS THE DOORS OF A CONTAINMENT TANK
            in back of one of their vehicles. Yet another REAVER (PRETTY
            BOY, not) assembles A SAVAGE HARPOON AND RESTRAINT SYSTEM.
                         
            But the Federale Commander suddenly orders his men to --
                         
                                               FEDERALE COMMANDER
                      Tomar el mutante!
                         
            AND THE CIRCLE OF FEDERALES MOVE IN ON LAURA.
                         
                                               PIERCE
                      Commander, stop!
                         
                                               FEDERALE COMMANDER
                      You said alive or dead.
                         
            SNIKT! -- BLOODY CLAWS EXTEND FROM LAURA'S KNUCKLES.
                         
                                               PIERCE
                      Laura! NO! NO!!
                         
            ON LOGAN-- He reacts to the claws. In shock. Cannot believe
            what he's seeing. With the attention on Laura, Logan starts
            moving, limping, back to the limo. His eyes meet--
                         
            Laura's. A moment of mutual recognition. It breaks as she
            turns to face the Federales.
                         
            ON CHARLES-- who, struggling against the meds, presses
            himself against the glass, staring at Laura.
          Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                 36.
                         
                         
                                               CHARLES
                      ...My Lord.
                         
            BACK TO LAURA AS -- THE FEDERALES LUNGE AT HER and, sadly for
            them, Laura leaps in the air and becomes a whirling dervish
            of death. Limbs and weapons sliced from her attackers like a
            topiary. Guns fire to no effect as Laura evades the shots.
                         
            This little girl has been created, designed and trained for
            one thing and one thing only: killing. And she's a virtuoso.
                         
            This wave dispatched, LAURA FLEES, HIDES BEHIND THE CATWALK
            SUPPORTS. The armed Federales hunt for her among the supports
            and she starts picking them off, one by one, with her blades
            and even with their own guns.
                         
            Suddenly, Laura is pinned against a concrete wall by A MUSCLE
            BOUND REAVER. With an acrobatic move, she boots him in the
            nuts and leaps over him, manages to run as--
                         
            PRETTY BOY FIRES THE HARPOON GUN, retracts the cable and pins
            her to the ground. REAVERS AND FEDERALES SURROUND HER and
            PRETTY BOY is about to put on the restraints when--
                         
            SNIKT! -- LOGAN GUTS PRETTY BOY FROM BEHIND-- AND ENGAGES THE
            OTHERS as Laura pulls the harpoon from her side and runs.
                         
            Laura is grabbed by THREE MORE REAVERS, WHO RESTRAIN HER AND
            STARTS TO DRAG HER AWAY -- BUT, SNIKT! --
                         
            TWO ADAMANTIUM FOOT CLAWS EMERGE FROM HER FEET dragging on
            the concrete, making a ringing sound, like chalk on a black
            board and -- suddenly -- with a double scissor-kick -- she
            stabs one Reaver in the thigh and the other in the throat,
            her gleaming foot claw sticking out the back of his neck.
                         
            Logan stares, slack-jawed. Then notices--
                         
            PIERCE AND ANOTHER REAVER are moving on the limo, about to
            take Charles. Logan tosses them back and--
                         
            INT./EXT. LIMO - ABANDONED SMELTING PLANT - CONTINUOUS
                         
            Logan drops behind the wheel, watching through the windshield
            as Laura takes on six or seven more hostiles.
                         
                                                CHARLES
                          (drunk with the meds)
                      ...As I said, Logan, she's a
                      mutant... Like you. Very much like
                      you, in fact.
                         
            Logan grimly starts the engine.
          Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                37.
                         
                         
                                               CHARLES (CONT'D)
                      Where are we going?
                         
            Logan ignores Charles as he put the limo in gear, gaining
            speed, and then-- MAKES A HARD U-TURN AND --
                         
            WHAM! PLOWS INTO THE FEDERALES AND LAURA (WHO JUMPS ON THE
            HOOD TO AVOID IMPACT).
                         
            Logan accelerates again, Laura clinging to the hood. Logan
            punches a button, opening the sunroof as gunfire starts to
            hit their limo.
                         
            Laura leaps into the limo. Charles smiles at her, pleased and
            seemingly oblivious to the gunfire:
                         
                                                CHARLES (CONT'D)
                      Laura!
                         
            As they take a hard turn, a side window shatters and LAURA
            INSTINCTIVELY SHIELDS CHARLES FROM THE BULLETS.
                         
            LAURA GETS HIT AND matter of factly sucks the slug out of her
            arm and spits it on the seat like Lee Marvin.
                         
            Logan meets eyes with Charles in his rear view. And that's
            when they are hit with A BARRAGE OF BULLETS--
                         
            WIDER -- SMELTING PLANT
                         
            THE FEDERALES HAVE LEAPT INTO THEIR JEEPS and fire at Logan's
            limo as they spin out in the dirt, in pursuit.
                         
            Disgusted, Pierce also gets behind the wheel and leads his
            Reavers in the opposite direction.
                         
            THE PLANT GATE BLOCKED BY THE ARMADA OF VEHICLES, Logan
            drives straight at the chainlink fence-- and we prepare for a
            classic action movie fence smash.
                         
                                                LOGAN
                      Hold on!
                         
            BUT THE LIMO HITS THE FENCE, BENDS THE SUPPORTS AND GRINDS TO
            A PATHETIC HALT, TANGLED IN MESH. As it would in real life.
                         
            Federales open fire at the limo as Logan guns the engine in
            reverse, trying to get traction on the dirt. Other Federales
            speed toward them on motorcycles.
                         
            Under massive fire, bullet-riddled, Logan's limo finds
            purchase, and he's backing out at high speed, ripping a long
            section of chain link from its posts and dragging this "tail"
            with him (driving backwards now).
          Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                   38.
                         
                         
            LOGAN SWERVES HARD AND THE CHAIN LINK "TAIL" SWINGS OUT AND
            WIPES OUT THE REAVER BIKES. One of the riders tumbles and
            grabs onto the chain link tail, the limo dragging him.
                         
            The Reaver claws his way along the chain link toward the hood
            of the car, drawing his gun, firing at the windshield.
                         
            Logan ducks and spins the car around. The dragging fence
            swings wide, LOSING THE REAVER ON THE FENCE.
                         
            Pierce angrily peels his truck in another direction.
                         
            Logan sees the main gate ahead. As he guns for it, he notices
            THE FLASHING RED TRAIN-WARNING LIGHTS at the loading dock.
                         
            TWO FEDERALE JEEPS reach the sides of the limo, guns aimed
            squarely at Logan. Laura and Charles react as--
                         
            Logan steers the limo through a series of concrete structures
            FORCING THE JEEPS INTO VIOLENT COLLISIONS.
                         
            Logan guns his limo into--
                         
            EXT. OPEN DESERT - DAY
                         
            LOGAN'S LIMO RACES FROM THE PLANT GROUNDS, APPROACHING--
                         
            A HULKING FREIGHT TRAIN arriving quickly from parallel
            tracks. The train is moving faster than the limo.
                         
            Logan makes a hard left, cranking the wheel just clipping the
            front corner of Pierce's truck, spinning toward the tracks.
                         
            THE TRAIN HAS ALMOST CAUGHT UP WITH THEM AS--
                         
            THE LIMO PLOWS STRAIGHT INTO THE SIDE OF A FEDERALE TRUCK
            which gets squeezed between the limo and train. Sparks fly.
                         
            LOGAN SPINS THE WHEEL, PUSHING THE TRUCK (and the Federale
            Commander in it) INTO THE PATH OF THE TRAIN AS--
                         
            LOGAN GUNS HIS LIMO ACROSS THE TRACKS ITS REAR END PINGED BY
            THE LOCOMOTIVE-- AND THE FEDERALE TRUCK OBLITERATED.
                         
            LOGAN'S LIMO COMES TO A STOP ON THE OTHER SIDE. Logan looks
            back through the moving freight cars at--
                         
            Pierce and the remaining Reavers, stuck until it passes.
            It's a long train.
                         
            EXT./INT. LIMO - RURAL HIGHWAY - DAY
                         
            Logan's battered limo racing at 120 mph.
          Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                  39.
                         
                         
            Logan's eyes darting to his rearview, peeled for any sign of
            Reavers. He glances back at --
                         
            LAURA, beside Charles, her gaze fixed out the window.
                         
                                               LOGAN
                      Who the fuck are you?
                         
            Laura slowly turns, acknowledging Logan's existence.
                         
                                               CHARLES
                      You know who she is, Logan.
                         
                                               LOGAN
                      No. I don't.

                      Does she remind you of anybody?
                         
            Laura holds Logan's glare with her own equally hard look.
                         
            Logan flares, peers tensely back out the windshield as he
            takes a hard turn.

            Donald Pierce steps over a mangled Reaver as the remaining
            "soldiers" clean up after the fight.

            He walks toward the main building, then looks back.

            Pierce steps inside and takes in the room. Picks up the RED
            SLICKER on the chair. Finds her ball in the pocket.
                         
            He turns as the DOOR IS OPENED and A SERIOUSLY INJURED
            CALIBAN is carried inside and shoved into a chair. He's
            hooked up to an IV, his head is covered with a HOOD.
                         
            Pierce rips off the hood and slaps Caliban's battered face.

            Caliban blinks his pale eyes open. Pierce sits down across
            from him and smiles.

                      You know, I read about you when I
                      was a kid. You tracked that crazy
                      gilled mutey fishy motherfuck, what
                      was his name, Wave?

                      Tracked him halfway `cross the
                      Atlantic they said. And you was
                      underwater. Inside a sub. And you
                      found him anyway. Shit. That's a
                      gift. That's trackin'!

                      thinking of someone else.
                         
            Pierce grins. SUDDENLY STRIKES Caliban with his metal hand.

            Caliban says nothing. Pierce picks up Laura's ball.

            Pierce turns toward the blacked out kitchen window.
            Starts to peel at the tar paper.
                         
                                               PIERCE
                      Of course that's what you'd say.
                      But then I got this theory that
                      people don't really change.
                         
            Pierce suddenly pulls the tar paper, RELEASING A SHARD OF
            BRIGHT SUNLIGHT. Caliban cries out, tries to turn away.

            Two Reavers force his face into the bright light. The
            mutant's eyes open. It burns.

                      Let's not bring out the worst in
                      each other. The girl's not worth
                      it. She's not a natural fuck-up
                      like you. She's a business mistake.

                      care about maybe.
                         
            Pierce nods to his men and they put the hood back over
            Caliban's head and haul him out, crying.

                      These children were born in this
                      building. They were born here and
                      they have never left. Never seen

            Gabriela's phone, propped on the coffee table. Logan hands
            Charles some pills and, after seeing him pop them in his
            mouth, turn back to the video.
          Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                   44.
                         
                         
                                GABRIELA (ON PHONE)
                      This is business. They are making
                      soldiers. Weapons X. These are
                      babies of mutantes muerta.
                         
            The video suddenly stops. Screen goes BLACK.
                         
                                               CHARLES
                      Is there more? Play it.
                         
            Logan puts on his reading glasses, picks up the phone, trying
            to get it to play again. As he does this, Charles spits out
            his pills and drops them in the seat crevice.
                         
                                               LOGAN
                      Battery's dead. We need a plug.
                         
                                                CHARLES
                      How far is it?
                          (off Logan's confusion)
                      To North Dakota.
                         
                                                LOGAN
                      Charles.
                         
                                               CHARLES
                      You took that woman's money. You
                      told her you would take the child
                      there.
                         
            Logan stares out the open door at--
                         
            LAURA, sitting solemnly in one of those "Bucking Bronco"
            rides as it bounces and plays a repeating fanfare.
                         
                                               LOGAN
                      What is she?
                         
                                                CHARLES
                      She's your daughter, Logan.
                          (off his glare)
                      Alkali had your genetic code.
                         
                                               LOGAN
                      Not just mine.
                         
            Outside, the horse ride has stopped moving. Laura hits the
            button over and over, but nothing happens. She bangs on the
            side and, still, nothing happens.
                         
                                                CHARLES
                      Logan...
          Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                   45.
                         
                         
                                               LOGAN
                      I don't wanna hear it. I don't want
                      to talk about it anymore.
                         
                                                CHARLES
                      Logan.
                         
                                                LOGAN
                      Stop.
                         
                                               CHARLES
                      I have to pee.
                         
            Logan looks at him. Oh.
                         
            EXT. TRUCK STOP -- DAY
                         
            ON LAURA AS -- SNIKT -- A CLAW comes out. She tries to jam it
            into the Bucking Bronco machine's coin slot. Logan grabs her
            wrist, holds out a QUARTER.
                         
                                               LOGAN
                      Last ride. Then we're leaving.
                         
            He nods to the claw, she retracts it. Then she grabs the
            quarter from him.
                         
                                               LOGAN (CONT'D)
                      You're welcome.
                         
            Logan crosses to the --
                         
            INT. TRUCK STOP MEN'S ROOM - DAY
                         
            We look at a half closed handicapped stall door as Logan and
            Charles shuffle about inside.
                         
                                               CHARLES
                      Stop it. For God's sake I can do
                      that myself!
                         
                                               LOGAN
                      Well, you're not doing it!
                         
            EXT. TRUCK STOP - DAY
                         
            As Logan wheels Charles back to the car, he looks over at the
            bucking bronco ride. LAURA'S GONE.
                         
            INT. TRUCK STOP CONVENIENCE STORE - DAY
                         
            Laura walks down an aisle, looking at the colorful products.
            She grabs a can of Pringles, starts in on it.
          Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                46.
                         
                         
            Then she stops and looks at a floor display of Hypno, Mag and
            all the variations of "energy drinks." Laura grabs a can,
            opens it and takes a long drink. She's bouncing as she walks
            now...
                         
            A CLERK looks up from his phone at her eating snacks.
                         
            Laura stops at a SUNGLASS RACK, munching. Notices a pair of
            shades. Puts them on, eats more, looking at herself.
                         
                                               CLERK
                      Yo. Girlie. You gotta pay for that.
                         
            Laura looks up with her mouth full. She starts for the door.
                         
            The Clerk blocks her way. She just looks up at him.
                         
                                               CLERK (CONT'D)
                      Where's your mommy and daddy?
                         
            She continues staring. Shoves some Pringles in her mouth.
                         
                                               CLERK (CONT'D)
                      Alright, that's enough--
                         
            He swipes the Pringles can from her hand, about to take the
            sunglasses from her nose, when, in a terrifyingly swift move,
            she throws the clerk to the floor, straddling him, hand on
            his throat the other raised-- SNIKT-- claws out.
                         
                                               CLERK (CONT'D)
                      Holy shit! Oh God Jesus, No!
                         
            That's when a hand again grabs Laura by the wrist.
                         
                                                 LOGAN
                      Not okay.
                         
            Logan pushes Laura to the door turns to the clerk--
                         
                                                 LOGAN (CONT'D)
                      Sorry.
                         
            --then grabs a handful of CIGARS and A PHONE CHARGER,
            stealing a look at a security camera on his way out.
                         
            INT. EXT LIMO -- OKLAHOMA -- NIGHT
                         
            A great starry sky as the desert becomes the plains. The limo
            sits, parked along a flat stretch of Oklahoma highway.
                         
            Laura and Charles are asleep in back.
          Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                47.
                         
                         
            Logan sits up front in the darkness, legs across the bench,
            staring at the road ahead and then at the Pennysaver clipping
            for the boat on his visor. And the envelope of cash.
                         
            A billboard up ahead hypes GAMBLING AND SHOWS IN OKLAHOMA
            CITY, 50 miles away.
                         
            There is a small beep. Logan sighs, looks down to Gabriela's
            pink phone plugged into the charger. It's come to life. He
            raises the partition and hits play.
                         
            ON THE PHONE SCREEN -- PART TWO OF GABRIELA'S VIDEO :
                         
            WE SEE A "STAFF MEMBER" PINNED ON THE FLOOR, SKIN SMOKING,
            his neck being gripped by a 9 year old with glowing eyes.
            People scream. "Leo! Basta! Basta!" The boy leans back and
            starts crying. The staff member is dead.
                         
                                               GABRIELA
                      As the children became older, they
                      became difficult to control.
                         
            ANOTHER SURREPTITIOUS VIDEO. A BUMPY SKINNED CHILD expertly
            shoots an automatic weapon into target dummies in an indoor
            range. SUDDENLY THEY TURN AND SHOOT THE INSTRUCTOR. SCREAMS.
                         
            A MOVING SHOT. THE BOY WITH GLOWING EYES is chased by
            security up a staircase to a rooftop. An alarm whoops. The
            boy lands outside and, for a moment, breathes air and stares
            at Mexico City. Panicked staff yell to him in Spanish as --
                         
            THE BOY THROWS HIMSELF OFF THE LEDGE.

                      They taught them to kill-- but they
                      did not remove their hearts.
                         
            ANOTHER CHILD IS FORCIBLY CUFFED IN A NOW FAMILIAR RESTRAINT
            SYSTEM, hissing, spitting, VIBRATING, loose objects flying
            around the room. OTHER CHILDREN WATCH. Some weep.
                         
                                               GABRIELA (CONT'D)
                      They could not be controlled.
                         
            ANOTHER SHOT -- A trickle of blood runs to a drain. TILT TO
            FIND A YOUNG LAURA IN A SMOCK, seemingly drugged, SITTING on
            the floor of a tiled room. She stares at her arm as she cuts
            it with a metal claw, then watches it heal, then cuts again.
                         
            The camera/phone drops and we see a dutched image of Laura as
            Gabriela comforts her, saying "What are you doing, baby?" in
            Spanish. Laura cries on her shoulder.

                      A soldier who cannot be controlled
                      is not a good soldier.
                         
            A LONG LENS GLIMPSE OF THE RED HAIRED MAN, temperamental,
            gesticulating, walking up a corridor, trailed by PIERCE.
                         
            NOW A SHOT FROM A MOVING CAR-- OF A WINDOWLESS STRUCTURE.

                      Inside this building is something
                      new. Something better than X-23.
                         
            STOLEN SHOTS FROM IN THE NEW BUILDING-- FLASHES OF TANKS
            CONTAINING ADULT HUMAN ORGANS, LIMBS submerged in liquids on
            collagen forms: arms, hearts, feet-- some being harvested.

                      I got inside yesterday.
                         
            THE RED HAIRED MAN confers with technicians. A Reaver notices
            Gabriela who hides her camera/phone. She claims (in Spanish)
            to be lost.
                         
                                               GABRIELA (CONT'D)
                      They told us to destroy files. They
                      said the Cancer program had failed.
                         
            The female Mexican staff, some crying, shred medical files as
            out the door a child is dragged away by A REAVER...
                         
                                               GABRIELA (CONT'D)
                      They started putting the children
                      to sleep. Like dogs.
                         
            We hear Gabriela telling them (in Spanish) that "we cannot
            let them do this". Some of the staff meet her eyes.

                      We are going to save as many as we
                      can. I have read about a place in
                      the north. A place for mutants.
                      They call it Eden.

                      I have not shown anyone what you
                      have now seen. Not until I am sure
                      Laura is safe.
                         
            AND NOW ON THE PHONE -- AN IMAGE OF GABRIELA LOPEZ IN THE

                                               GABRIELA (CONT'D)
                      If you are watching this, it means
                      I am dead. I am not sure if any
                      other children survived. We were
                      separated. I am sorry, but there is
                      no more money. That was a lie. You
                      have everything I have in my life.
                         
            Logan reacts to this.
                         
                                                GABRIELA (CONT'D)
                      She is not my child... but I love
                      her. You may not love her but she
                      is your child. I see now you are
                      not a hero. You are not what I read
                      about. Maybe you never were. But
                      please, I beg you, please bring her
                      to safety.
                         
            The recording ends. Logan tosses the phone down.
                         
            He reaches up for the mirror, adjusts it so he can see--
                         
            Laura. Lying there, in a ball, sleeping, a plastic horse doll
            in her hands. Some comic books under her head. Suddenly, she
            awakes, her eyes meeting his. And holding.
                         
            Logan blinks under the weight of her gaze. Then she looks
            away and rolls over.
                         
            INT./ EXT. LOGAN'S LIMO -- OKLAHOMA CITY -- NIGHT
                         
            Laura awakes on the leatherette bench and looks up to
            Charles, sleeping soundly, holding her hand. Colored light
            passes over his face. She turns to see lights playing outside
            her window. She sits up to face--
                         
            THE SPECTACLE OF A MODERN GAMBLING STRIP. Dancing lights and
            thematic facades throb like fireworks. A car passes, blasting
            thumping hip hop.
                         
            Charles blinks awake. We see in his eyes a quiet panic as he
            looks out at his surroundings and, for a moment, seems to
            have no idea how he got here nor who these people are.

            Laura meets his eyes. It starts to come back to him. He looks
            out the window as they pull into a Casino parking area.
                         
                                               CHARLES

                      We're not hiding out. We're gonna
                      get a couple hours sleep, clean up,
                      get new clothes, ditch the limo,
                      get a new ride and get the fuck
                      out.
                         
            EXT. OKLAHOMA CITY CASINO/HOTEL - VALET - NIGHT
                         
            Logan pulls to a stop a valet who eagerly approaches until he
            sees the thrashed condition of their ride and its frazzled
            passengers. Logan hands him cash.
                         
                                               LOGAN
                      Keep it out front.
                         
            Laura steps out, clinging to her horse. Dazzled by the
            throbbing lights and sexy throbbing musak.
                         
            INT. OKLAHOMA CITY CASINO/HOTEL - LOBBY - NIGHT
                         
            Weary, Logan holds an electronic key in his hand as the
            threesome moves past slots and gambling tables still
            operating in the middle of the night. Laura is overwhelmed by
            noise, lights and activity. She jumps WHEN A LOUD BELL RINGS
            as someone wins a jackpot. Charles puts a hand on her.
                         
            Logan hits the UP button of the elevator and, as they wait
            for the doors to open, they all looks at--
                         
            A DISPLAY FOR A CASINO CLOTHING STORE. A male mannequin in
            handsome western wear stands beside a shapely Cowgirl and a
            little kid mannequin in a unicorn tee/skirt and studded denim
            jacket. Charles eyes a suit and hat on a mannequin in an easy
            chair with a pipe.
                         
            Bing! -- the elevator doors open.
                         
            INT. OKLAHOMA CITY CASINO/HOTEL - ELEVATOR - NIGHT
                         
            They enter, Logan pushing Charles who carries shopping bags
            in his lap and tries on a new hat, tag attached. As the doors
            close, Logan presses their floor, the button lights and Laura
            starts to press other floors. Logan swats her hand.
                         
            Meanwhile, Charles digs in the bag, offers Logan a new
            baseball hat with a tag on it, tissue paper falling.

                      Please wait till we're in the room.
                         
            The doors suddenly re-open and there are A COUPLE (dressed
            nicely) and awkwardness as Logan hits the door close button.
                         
                                               LOGAN (CONT'D)
                      Sorry. Going up.
                         
            Laura starts hitting other buttons again. He swats her again.
                         
            INT. OKLAHOMA CITY CASINO/HOTEL - SUITE - DAWN
                         
            Oklahoma City lies beyond the big windows, morning light
            filling this well appointed suite. We see the remains of a
            room service breakfast. Clothing wrappers and boxes are
            scattered about. In a robe, Laura helps Charles finish
            donning his new outfit. Suddenly, there are gunshots from the
            TV. Laura turns.
                         
            ON SCREEN -- A shootout in a 50's technicolor Western.

                      This film is a classic, Laura.
                      Almost a hundred years old now. I
                      first saw it at the Esoldo in
                      Dewsbury when I was your age.

            INT. HOTEL - SUITE - BATHROOM - SAME
                         
            A line of mini bar bottles stacked on the sink, Logan dresses
            in front of the mirror. Exhaustion catching up with him, his
            body still scarred from the battle at the smelting plant. He
            finished buttoning a new shirt. Picks up his hat.
                         
            His eyes land upon Laura's bloody clothes on the floor. Her
            backpack nearby. Logan opens the backpack, pulls out those
            files he'd seen before. TRANSIGEN and ALKALI stamped on them.
                         
            He flips through them -- records for the young mutants (some
            we saw on Gabriela's videos), we glimpse details:

            trees, plants, a sort of green "Magneto".

            Logan keeps flipping through the files, until he finds the
            one he's really looking for: LAURA.
                         
            "High IQ" "Volatile emotional swings" "Difficult to control"
            "Signs of Manic Depression in source genetics."
                         
            "SOURCE DNA: JAMES HOWLETT."
                         
            Clinical photos of Laura's Adamantium implant. Medical images
            of this little girl on a stainless table, in exquisite pain.
                         
            Logan can't look anymore. They bring back his own dark
            memories. Closing it, he finds a WRINKLED PHOTO clipped to
            the back. It's of GABRIELA AND ANOTHER NURSE (MARIA) WITH
            OTHER YOUNG MUTANTS IN A LAB. On back is that address in
            North Dakota. And a list of names: "Delilah, Rictor, Bobby,
            Rebecca, Laura and Charlotte."
                         
            Logan tucks the file back in the backpack, then notices
            something else... wadded in a side pocket.
                         
            SEVERAL COMIC BOOKS. X-MEN comic books.

            They start sealing it off, and head in to the MINI MART...

            Where a battered Caliban sits, guarded by a Reaver, the red
            slicker in his lap. The Reaver beside him reaches over and
            raises the SHADE. Caliban recoils and we now see the blisters
            on his face from the previous exposure to light.

            Laura finishes tying her NEW SHOES amid some clothing boxes.
            She also wears a new unicorn shirt, new skirt and leggings.
            The ones from the display. She's pleased and meets eyes with--
          Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                53.
                         
                         
            Logan, who emerges from the bathroom with the backpack. He
            doubletakes at her, then grabs another bottle from the mini
            bar. We hear canned gunfire from the next room.
                         
            Laura crosses to Charles in the bedroom and sits on the edge
            of the bed where he is watching "Shane." On screen, the big
            "shoot out" grabs Laura's attention.
                         
            Logan walks in, watching indifferently.
                         
            Laura remains riveted as on-screen-- SHANE KNEELS DOWN AND
            SAYS GOODBYE TO LITTLE JOEY:

                      A man has to be what he is, Joey.
                      Can't break the mould. I tried and
                      it didn't work. There's no living
                      with a killing. There's no going
                      back. Right or wrong, it's a brand.
                      A brand that sticks. Now run on
                      home to your mother, and you tell
                      her... everything's alright and
                      there aren't any more guns in the
                      valley.
                         
            Logan looks up as he hears a sigh from Charles.
                         
            Logan clears his throat and they both turn his way. He holds
            up the THE X-MEN COMIC.

            She sees the comic in his hand, backpack in the other--gets
            up and grabs them both from Logan and turns back to the film.

                      And none like this. In the real
                      world, people die and no self
                      promoting asshole in a leotard can
                      stop it. This is just ice cream for

            Logan turns to Charles who forces a smile.
                         
                                                CHARLES (CONT'D)
                      I think Laura well understands
                      life's impermanence.

                                               CHARLES (CONT'D)
                      Didn't you say something about
                      finding us a new ride?
                         
            Logan looks at the two of them, all chummy now, and gets up.
                         
                                               LOGAN
                      Right. Fine.
                         
            He pauses at the door and tosses a pill vial to Charles.
            Laura catches it.
                         
                                               LOGAN (CONT'D)
                      Take two more in an hour.
                         
                                               CHARLES
                      Good-bye, Logan.
                         
            INT./EXT. LIMO - OUTSKIRTS OF OKLAHOMA CITY - DAY
                         
            As Logan drives past a USED CAR dealership. He goes around
            the corner, starts looking around, goes another few blocks
            until he sees what he's looking for--
                         
            EXT. OKLAHOMA CITY - SIDE STREET - DAY
                         
            Shitty block. Graffiti everywhere. A GANG OF YOUNG THUGS hang
            beneath the interstate overpass.
                         
            Logan gets out of his limo, checks the back, sees a couple
            more of Laura's UNCANNY X-MEN COMICS lying on the bench.
            Grabs them. Checks that's everything. Then finds several of
            Charles pills wedged in the car seat.
                         
                                                LOGAN
                      ...Fuck.
                         
            He slams the door, walking past THE THUGS, tossing them the
            LIMO KEYS.
                         
                                               LOGAN (CONT'D)
                      Knock yourselves out.
                         
            Walking toward the car lot, Logan eyes the cars in the lot
            all with sale written on their windshields.
                         
            Behind him, the thugs cross to the limo, glancing at Logan
            before getting in, and laying rubber in the other direction.
            Logan flips the liquor bottle in the trash.
                         
            EXT. OKLAHOMA CITY CAR LOT - DAY
                         
            Logan stands before a USED RAM FOUR DOOR with a large cab,
            shell in back and faded electrician signage on the sides.
            A Dealer smoking a vape stands too close.
          Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                  55.
                         
                         
                                               DEALER
                      I know the finish looks beat but
                      it's a `19, got less than sixty on
                      the ody and three hundred horses
                      under the hood. For 10 grand I can
                      get it re-painted for you, fresh
                      tires mounted and balanced, and
                      complete paperwork.
                         
                                               LOGAN
                      ...yeah. Here's the thing. I'll
                      give you twelve as is-- if you can
                      forget the paperwork.
                         
            The dealer smiles. Looks at the money Logan is holding.
                         
                                               DEALER
                      You still need tires, tiger.
                      They're bald.
                         
                                               LOGAN
                      How long is that gonna take?
                         
                                               DEALER
                      Hour, maybe less. If you want, you
                      can get yourself a glass a lunch
                      across the street while you wait.
                         
            Logan looks to the BAR / LOUNGE across the street. Inviting.
                         
            INT. BAR - MOMENTS LATER - DAY
                         
            Logan sits, glancing at the television news, sipping a high
            ball as he stares at one of Laura's UNCANNY X-MEN COMICS. The
            images weigh on Logan. He downs his drink and shuts the
            comic, then he sees another XMEN COMIC.
                         
            His face becomes grim as he stares at THE COVER. It features
            a DRAMATIC MUTANT TREK INTO THE MOUNTAINS. The title: "EXODUS
            TO EDEN!" A subtitle: "MUTANT TRAIL OF TEARS!".
                         
            On the cover and pages to follow, THOUSANDS OF MUTANTS,
            FLEEING OPPRESSION, UNDER ATTACK, headed for a place called
            "Eden" in a vast wasteland. They're being lead by XMEN, among
            them Wolverine and Xavier. Wolverine in his yellow suit.
                         
                                               LOGAN
                      Jesus Christ...
                         
            Logan turns the page where it is revealed-- "EDEN" IT'S A
            HIDDEN COMPOUND. On top of a cliff. Mutants are there, young
            and old, thriving. Text in a panel reads--
          Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                56.
                         
                         
            "AMERICA, NO LONGER SAFE FOR MUTANTS! OUR HEROES FIND REFUGE
            IN EDEN: LAST STOP ON THE MUTANT UNDERGROUND TO CANADA!"
                         
            AN INSET ON A SPLASH PAGE SHOWS A MAPPING DEVICE IN XAVIER'S
            HAND. On the screen, a series of numbers, coordinates.
                         
            Logan blinks, looking at the cash envelope he got from
            Gabriela. The exact same numbers are scrawled on it below the
            fire road address. Logan glares, taking in the bald fact that
            Eden is an imaginary place in a forty year old comic book.
                         
                                               LOGAN (CONT'D)
                      `you gotta be fuckin' kidding me.

                      You want a refill?
                         
            Logan looks up, still dazed. He shuts the comic.
                         
                                               LOGAN
                      I'll take the bottle.

                      You passing through?
                         
            Logan nods. Puts down a large bill.
                         
                                               BARTENDER (CONT'D)
                      Where you headed?
                         
                                               LOGAN
                      I don't know.
                         
            EXT. OKLAHOMA CITY CASINO/HOTEL - VALET - LATE DAY
                         
            Logan lurches the new used pick up to a stop at the hotel
            entrance. Gets out and does not give the keys to the Valet--
                         
                                               VALET
                      Sir? Are the keys in it?
                         
            That's when he sees-- A MAN WITH A PROSTHETIC (CYBORG) HAND
            standing at the entrance, talking in a cell phone.
                         
            Alarmed, Logan rounds the corner, moving past--
                         
            A HOTEL GARDENER with a hedge trimmer, touching up a shrub.
            Looking for a side entrance, Logan passes other patrons, but
            as he does, he clocks--
                         
            BLACK VEHICLES parked in a service entrance. And that's when
            it hits-- A RINGING SOUND. A SCREECH and Logan turns to see --
          Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                57.
                         
                         
            CARS CRASHING INTO EACH OTHER ON THE STREET. He turns back to
            see the Worker unconscious on the ground, the hedge trimmer
            whirring and bouncing in the grass.
                         
            THE RINGING GETS LOUDER. Casino patrons are frozen in place,
            struggling to breathe.
                         
            INT. REAVERS COMMAND TRUCK -- LATE DAY
                         
            We see LOGAN OUT THE WINDSHIELD as he moves toward the casino
            doors-- and we PAN TO--
                         
            PIERCE AND A REAVER ASSOCIATE at a command console inside the
            truck. But they too are PARALYZED FROM THE PSIONIC WAVE,
            CHOKING FOR AIR. In the bg, a battered burned Caliban is also
            paralyzed by the wave, vibrating in his restraints.
                         
            We see on the console monitor, video feeds of body cams,
            quivering but frozen pictures of our hero's suite. We hear
            the sound of men struggling to breathe over the audio feed.
            Alarms are ringing.
                         
            INT. OKLAHOMA CITY CASINO/HOTEL -- LOBBY -- LATE DAY
                         
            The RINGING LOUDER YET as Logan stumbles through the lobby
            passing Desk Clerks, Bellhops, Guests, all paralyzed.
                         
            CLOSE ON -- LOGAN struggling forward. THE RINGING INCREASES
            as he lurches, zig-zagging the crowded floor jammed with
            PARALYZED GAMBLERS, DEALERS, CROUPIERS, etc.
                         
            A man sits, frozen, beside a slot machine spitting chips.

            LOGAN SPRINTS PAST A CASINO ESCALATOR-- passing paralyzed
            hotel patrons being tossed off like toy soldiers--
                         
            Struggling to the elevators, pressing the button.
            Doors open and more people fall out.
                         
            INT. OKLAHOMA CITY CASINO ELEVATOR
                         
            As Logan rides up, RINGING GETS LOUDER.
                         
                                               LOGAN

            And BING the doors open and -- THE SOUND DEAFENING--
          Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                  58.

            AS LOGAN LEAPS OFF THE ELEVATOR and fights his way through
            the rippling force, past A MAID, FROZEN beside her cart,
            struggling for air to make it around the corner and down the
                           HALL TOWARD--
                         
            THE CRACKED SUITE DOOR WHERE TWO ARMED REAVERS stand frozen
            and gurgling for air, their weapons pointed inward.
                         
            SNIKT! -- LOGAN'S TARNISHED CLAWS EMERGE AND --
                         
            HE GUTS THE TWO FROZEN HELPLESS REAVERS IN TWO QUICK THRUSTS.
            Their blood and guts pour to the floor, their eyes wide as
            they perish in a standing rigor mortis.
                         
            INT. REAVERS COMMAND TRUCK -- LATE DAY
                         
            PIERCE, HIS ASSOCIATE AND CALIBAN, still paralyzed the wave.
            We see on their body cam monitors as Logan skewers the men,
            their life support monitors blinking -- AGENT TERMINATED.
                         
            INT. OKLAHOMA CITY CASINO/HOTEL -- SUITE -- LATE DAY
                         
            Logan pushes through THE DOOR TO FIND-- A SURREAL SCENE:
            THREE MORE REAVERS FROZEN IN MID ATTACK. The room service
            cart up-ended.
                         
            CHARLES sits slumped in his chair, near the window, mouth in
            a rictus-like grimace, body quivering, rippling waves of
            force emanating from his skull.
                         
            LAURA, HER CLAWS OUT, is on the floor, semi-paralyzed,
            struggling to pull herself toward Charles' meds. She reaches
            the hypodermic, attempts to hand it to --
                         
            Logan who falls to his knees from the shrieking wave. He
            fumbles, almost dropping it, eyes starting to roll up in his
            own head as he lunges and jams the needle into Charles' neck.
                         
            After a moment, RINGING stops -- Logan falls back-- the
            remaining Reavers fall to the ground and, as they gasp for
            air, Laura and Logan kill them all. Brutal.
                         
            Charles is spent dazed, gasping for air.
                         
            Logan peers down at one of the dead Reavers, checking him
            out, peering into his BODYCAM.

            Dealers, Bellhops, patrons all stumble about in a daze --
            children crying -- some people are vomiting or clawing at
            their heads. SIRENS IN THE DISTANCE.
                         
            As Logan comes out of an elevator pushing a dazed Charles in
            his chair, Laura follows. Charles is horrified.
                         
                                               CHARLES
                      I'm so sorry. Oh God...
                         
            INT. OKLAHOMA CITY CASINO/HOTEL - CASINO FLOOR - DAY
                         
            Logan pushes Charles, fast, and Laura follows, dragging her
            backpack, making their way toward the glass doors.
                         
            They zig zag through the crowd of recently unstuck patrons
            and employees, many sick and stumbling, choking, some crying,
            some scream for medical help.
                         
            Bouncing in his chair, Charles stares at the suffering around
            him, stricken with empathy-- and guilt.
                         
            Laura lingers, watching A FAT MAN GET CPR FROM A PANICKED
            COCKTAIL WAITRESS. The man suddenly comes to life, sucking
            air. The waitress' face fills with wonder. Laura stares.

            Catching up, Laura follows Logan and Charles out the casino
            doors. We hear the rising sirens of approaching first
            responders as the trio moves to the new pick up truck.
                         
                                                 LOGAN

            Logan lifts Charles into the back seat, throws the chair in
            back bed and gets in. Laura climbs in beside Charles, who
            stares out the back window at the chaos as they pull away.
                         
            The camera pans with them as they depart, then finds--
                         
            SEVERAL REAVER VEHICLES parked at the side of the building.
                         
            MOVING IN ON -- THE REAVER COMMAND TRUCK. THE BACK DOORS
            suddenly BURST OPEN. PIERCE stumbles out, dazed, sweaty. He
            looks to emergency trucks approaching, cherry topped. Then
            his eyes find-- FIVE REAVERS.

            Restrained in the back of the truck, Caliban, blistered and
            weak, watches PIERCE, who leans against the truck to support
            himself, chugs some water until he feels Caliban's stare and
            SLAMS THE DOOR.

            from the Oklahoma City, topography has changed.
                         
            The sun breaks over the horizon. The radio chatters with
            breaking news reports on the event at the Casino--
            speculation of a gas leak or food poisoning.

            Logan SNAPS off the radio, quickly looks in back to see if
            Charles overheard it. Charles was sleeping. Opens his eyes.
                         
            CLICK. CLACK. CLICK.
            Logan's eyes flit to Laura playing with the door lock.

            Laura looks from one to the other, nervous for the first time
            since she climbed into the car with these two. She starts
            flicking the locks again.

            Logan realizes he's gone too far, tosses the bottle of pills

            Laura hesitantly hands them to Charles who looks at Logan in
            the mirror, holds up a pill for him to see, takes one.

            out, puts on her shades.

                      than her behind us.
                          (looks at Laura)
                      I need you to please try and not
                      kill this lady. Okay?
                         
            Laura retracts her claws.
                         
            EXT. FARM COUNTRY HIGHWAY - DAY
                         
            The female TROOPER, mirrored Ray-Bans (some things never
            change), raps on the window. Logan lowers it, smiles.

            Laura looks at Logan. A pause. Then... nods.

            EXT. REAVER CARAVAN -- OUTSKIRTS OF OKLAHOMA CITY -- DAY
                         
            THE CARAVAN OF REAVER VEHICLES is parked in a large paved
            pull out area, like a weigh station or rest stop. Local
            police wave traffic past, clearing the way for--
                         
            A FLATBED TRUCK approaching with a police escort.
            THERE IS A HUGE BOX STRAPPED IN THE BACK OF THE TRUCK.
          Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                   65.
                         
                         
            CLOSE ON -- PIERCE, looking from the arriving flatbed to --
                         
            A HELICOPTER growing larger in the sky.
                         
            INT./EXT. REAVER CONTROL TRUCK -- CONTINUOUS
                         
            Beaten, burned and shaking, confined in the back, Caliban
            hears the approaching chopper and peers out through a
            security window, watching--
                         
            The helicopter land on the blacktop. He shifts to a second
            window to see a better view of--
                         
            THE RED HAIRED MAN FROM THE LAB, as he steps out of the
            chopper and heads directly to Pierce. A silent movie as
            Pierce gets his ass handed to him.
                         
            Caliban's attention shifts back to the first window as--
                         
            THE FLATBED TRUCK pulls up next to the control truck. Its
            HANDLERS look nervous. Inside the big box strapped in back,
            there is some sort banging, then a low guttural screaming.
                         
            Now, the Red Haired Man, carrying a medical case, approaches
            the flatbed and opens the back hatch, disappearing the big
            box. The screaming subsides.
                         
            Caliban collapses to the floor. Closes his eyes.
                         
            EXT. FARM COUNTRY HIGHWAY - DAY
                         
            As the pick-up truck passes a billboard that reads
                         
            WELCOME TO CORN COUNTRY: HEART OF AMERICA.
                         
            Fields on either side of the endless ribbon of road. In the
            fields are HUGE AUTOMATED THRESHERS/HARVESTERS. The machines
            are several times bigger than what we see on farms today.
                         
            INT./EXT. PICK UP - FARM COUNTRY HIGHWAY - DAY
                         
            As Logan navigates the pick-up through what looks like a
            canyon of big trucks. Laura, face pressed to the glass,
            stares up and out the window at all of them.
                         
            One of them inches over and Logan is almost run off the road.
                         
                                                LOGAN

            He hits the HORN, looks up at the driverless truck cab as he
            pulls around.
          Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                66.
                         
                         
                                               LOGAN (CONT'D)

                                               CHARLES
                      Language, Logan. And you're
                      screaming at a machine.
                         
            Logan flips off the truck anyway as he passes, gets clear of
            all of them. Logan sees Charles shake his head.
                         
                                               LOGAN
                      What, she can gut a man with her
                      feet, but she can't hear naughty
                      words?
                         
                                               CHARLES
                      She can learn to be better.
                         
                                               LOGAN
                      You mean, better than me.
                         
                                                CHARLES
                      Actually, yes. And by the way,
                      Laura's foot claws are an obvious
                      result of her gender.
                          (off Logan's look)
                      In a pride of lions, females are
                      caregivers of the young and hunters
                      of the pride, they have front claws
                      to hunt and foot claws for defense.
                      They use the foot claw to strike
                      the belly or bladder of the
                      attacker, thus ensuring their
                      escape and survival.
                         
            Laura takes this in, turns and looks out the other window.
            Logan sighs and drives on.
                         
            LAURA'S POV - ANOTHER CAR An older farm pick up truck towing
            A HORSE TRAILER. Laura stares at the animals as they pass.
                         
            In the back seat of the pick up sits A TEENAGE BOY. He looks
            back at Laura. Up front are his MOTHER and FATHER. They also
            look this way, smile. A farm family.
                         
            Soon Logan has left them behind, too. A moment of quiet in
            the car. Logan looks in the rearview at Charles and Laura.
            Both seem calm, even serene, as they gaze out their windows,
            Laura still looking back at the horses. ...Almost normal.
                         
            But then A LOUD HORN and Logan looks ahead as he's nearly run
            off the road by one of the GIANT HULKING VEHICLES coming in
            the other direction, crossing into his lane.
          Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                  67.
                         
                         
            Logan pulls the wheel one way then swerves back as LAURA'S
            CLAWS EXTEND AND PUNCH THROUGH THE ROOF with one hand, holds
            Charles with the other so they don't get thrown.
                         
            Logan struggles to gain control of the pick-up, spins the
            truck around so it's facing on-coming traffic, avoids ANOTHER
            MEGA-TRUCK coming at them before he finally gets the pick-up
            onto the shoulder, facing in the direction they came from.
                         
            The three of them watch down the highway from the shoulder
            (looking in the direction of where they just came) as--
                         
            THE FAMILY TOWING THE HORSE TRAILER ARE RUN OFF THE ROAD by
            one of the SAME CAREENING MEGA TRUCKS. Their horse trailer
            tipping onto its side at an angle, its doors swinging wide.
                         
            Logan, Charles and Laura watch as -- FOUR HORSES now leap
            from the trailer, running free...
                         
                                                  LOGAN
                         Shit. Oh well.
                         
            Logan twists the wheel, prepares to pull back onto the
            highway and drive away. Charles puts a hand on his shoulder.
                         
                                                  CHARLES
                         We have to help them.

                         We have to keep moving. Someone
                         will come along.
                         
                                                  CHARLES
                         Someone has come along.
                         
            The Father, Mother and Teenage Son run after THE HORSES NOW
            ON THE HIGHWAY. ANOTHER MEGA TRUCK NEARLY MISSING THEM.
                         
            Logan sighs, straightening the wheel and driving up the
            shoulder toward them. Charles watches as--
                         
                                                  MOTHER

            A mesmerized Laura climbs out of the pick-up, watching as--
                         
            Nate pulls himself onto the bare back of one of the horses by
            the mane, holds onto the other by a halter.
                         
            Logan climbs out of the pick up and approaches the father,
            who has crossed back to the trailer and cursing (rated G),
            tries to get the wagon out of the ditch. His wife climbs
            behind the wheel, gently spinning the tires to no effect.

            and his ability with horses. But mostly by the boy.
                         
            The Mother now exits the cab, joins Nate, helping him load
            the horses back into the carrier. She notices her son is
            angry. He slams the tailer doors behind them.

            Logan smiles at her. There's a connection. Kathryn looks at
            their truck, sees Laura.

            Logan sees Laura standing beside the truck in the stolen
            shades, watching them. The boy now notices her for the first
            time. Charles peers out the side door.

                                RED-HAIRED MAN (O.S.)
                      In the 1950's, in an effort to
                      increase honey production in the
                      tropics, a Brazilian research team
                      cross-bred the European Honey Bee,
                      Apis mellifera, the classic model,
                      and a heartier stronger African
                      variety, Apis mellifera capensis.
                         
            Caliban opens his eyes and looks up at THE RED-HAIRED MAN.
            His manner is soft, warm. His voice seductive, smooth.
                         
                                RED-HAIRED MAN (CONT'D)
                      These hybrid bees were stronger and
                      aggressive to be sure, but despite
                      their fortitude, they made no honey
                      at all, nor assist in pollination.
                      In the lab, they did little, in
                      fact, besides killing other bees.
                         
            THE MAN sits close to CALIBAN, shining a pinlight on his
            lesions, in his ears. Examining. He smiles.

                      The researchers wanted to help
                      mankind, but instead, they created
                      monsters. And before they could
                      correct their error, a few escaped
                      to the wild. And these bees formed
                      a swarm and spread across Brazil
                      and multiplied, moving up the
                      continent, killing men women and
                      children. Even worse, these killer
                      hybrids threatened the viability of
                      the worldwide bee population and
                      subsequently, human survival.

                      The girl is a rather small price to
                      pay for that. Unlike you, she's not
                      pure. She wasn't made by nature.
                      She's a mistake of my own. A killer
                      bee who's escaped from the hive.

            The Munson family and the "Howlett" family all sit around a
            table covered with food, heads bowed as the son says grace.
            All except Laura who looks around at the family pictures, the
            religious decorations (they are everywhere), the warm
            furnishings. Another strange place.

            They look at each other.
                         
                                               CHARLES (CONT'D)

                                                CHARLES
                      Yes. Long overdue. We're city folk.
                      Always wanted to take a road trip,
                      see the country.

            Logan looks up at Charles. Watches him. The old man having
            himself a good time.
                         
                                               KATHRYN
                      That sounds lovely. I've been
                      trying to get Will here to take a
                      vacation for years now.
                         
                                               WILL
                      And if we go out traipsing around
                      the country, who's gonna take care
                      of this place?
                         
                                               KATHRYN
                      Exactly. I say, let it go.
                         
                                               WILL
                      And live off what?
                         
                                               KATHRYN
                      The Lord will provide.
                         
                                               WILL
                      Well, I'm still waiting for him to
                      provide me with a new thresher.

                      All the same, I'd love to travel
                      someday.
                         
                                               CHARLES

            Friendly laughter around the table. THE SOUND FADES. PASSAGE
            OF TIME AS Laura watches the ritual of Family Dinner. Studies
            it. She's never really seen a family. Or, for that matter, a
            teenage boy. She keeps her eyes fixed on him.
                         
            Then as DINNER FINISHES AND CLEAN UP BEGINS--
                         
                                               CHARLES
                      Kathryn, that was easily the best
                      meatloaf I've ever had.
                         
                                               KATHRYN

            Charles gives Logan a look across the table. Kathryn turns to
            Logan now. Smiles.
                         
                                               KATHRYN (CONT'D)
                      What about you, James. Are you
                      married?

                      Kathryn.
                         
                                               KATHRYN
                      What? It's a natural thing to ask.
                         
                                               CHARLES
                      He was. She passed.
                         
                                               KATHRYN
                      Oh, I'm so sorry.
                         
            Will gives her a look that says, See? That's why you don't
            ask shit like that!
                         
                                               CHARLES
                      He killed her.
                         
            Logan looks up at Charles. An awkward beat. Then they all
            burst out laughing. Logan considers Charles across the table.
            Was that Dementia? A joke?
                         
            Logan smiles at Kathryn, stands.

                      dinner. But we have a long drive
                      ahead of us.

                      They're gonna stay here. We have a
                      perfectly fine room upstairs for
                      your daughter and father and you
                      can sleep in the living room on the
                      convertible.

                                               CHARLES
                      We could leave first thing in the
                      morning. Crack of dawn as it were.
                         
            Logan grabs Charles' wheelchair.
                         
                                               LOGAN

            INT. FARMHOUSE -- BATHROOM -- SAME
                         
            Logan counts out two pills to Charles who finishes splashing
            water on his face, and grabs a towel. They whisper.
                         
                                               CHARLES
                      --two days on the road with one
                      meal and hardly any sleep. She's
                      eleven and I'm fucking ninety.

                      That's a hundred and one reasons to
                      keep moving.
                         
                                               CHARLES
                      I'm not a box of avocados.

                      And then what. We stay the night
                      and then what?
                         
                                                CHARLES
                      We take Laura to her friends in

                      Sunseeker.
                         
            Logan just stares back at him, hands him his pills, goes to
            fill a cup of water. The faucet sputters and spits air. The
            pipes shudder all through the house.

            Logan emerges from the bathroom, Charles follows.

                      lose pressure.
                         
            Nate dutifully rushes into the bathroom, starts the tub.

                      rain last night.
                         
            Kathryn gently touches Will's arm. Her hand slides down to
            his. Laura is fascinated by the simple gesture.

                                               WILL
                      Oh, no. Thank you. But these men
                      who did this, they can be--
                         
                                                  NATE
                      I'll come.
                         
                                               KATHRYN
                      No. You have homework.
                         
                                                  LOGAN
                      I'll go.
                         
            Kathryn and Logan meet eyes.
                         
                                               LOGAN (CONT'D)
                      Just let me get my dad... settled.
                         
            Logan wheels Charles toward the stairs. Nate passes them and
            stomps up the steps. Laura watches.
                         
            INT. FARMHOUSE -- HALLWAY -- NIGHT
                         
            Laura comes to the top of the stairs and looks at Charles'
            empty wheel chair in the hallway. Logan carries Charles into
            a lit bedroom at the end of the hall. A sweet sight.
                         
            Laura turns looking in the cracked door of Nate's bedroom.
                         
            INT. GUEST BEDROOM -- SAME
                         
            Inside the guest room, Logan tucks Charles in. Charles looks
            out the window beside the bed. The moon over the silos.
                         
                                               LOGAN
                      There's a TV in here.
                         
                                                CHARLES
                                         (SMILES GENTLY)
                      I'm fine.
                         
                                               LOGAN
                      Okay... Get some rest.
                         
            As Logan turns away, Charles reaches for him.
                         
                                                CHARLES
                      You know, Logan. This is what life
                      looks like. A house, people who
                      love each other. A safe place. Take
                      a moment and feel it.
                                         (BEAT)
                      You still have time.

            Logan looks off, distant. Troubled.
                         
                                               LOGAN
                      Charles. The world is not the same
                      as it was. We're taking a risk
                      here. And where we're going. Eden.
                      It doesn't exist. Her nurse got it
                      from a comic book.
                         
            Charles stays quiet.
                         
                                               LOGAN (CONT'D)
                      You just need to understand-- it's
                      not real.
                         
            Charles looks up at Logan, his tone gentle, and firm.
                         
                                               CHARLES
                      It is for Laura.
                         
            INT. FARMHOUSE - DEN - NIGHT
                         
            Logan passes Laura as he comes down the stairs. He follows
            Will down the hall. A GUN COCKS and Logan sees Will has
            opened A CABINET, tucking a pistol in his waistband.
                         
                                                WILL
                                         (SMILES)
                      Don't worry. We won't need it.
                         
            EXT. FARMHOUSE - DIRT ROAD - NIGHT
                         
            As Logan and Will carry tools along a dirt access road...
                         
                                               WILL
                      Canewood Beverage bought up
                      everything out here. Except us.
                      When we wouldn't sell, they tried
                      eminent domain. Then screwing with
                      our water. Couple months ago,
                      someone poisoned our dogs.

                      So today, out on the highway--
                         
                                               WILL
                      Who knows. Maybe.
                         
            Looking at the giant harvesters working the dark fields.
                         
                                               WILL (CONT'D)
                      They're like dinosaurs. Twenty ton
                      bodies with little tiny brains.

                                               WILL (CONT'D)
                      They work day and night, no
                      drivers, shucking their cloned up
                      super-corn. Bears fruit in half the
                      time. Taste like shit, though.

                      So why do people eat it?
                         
                                                WILL
                      They don't. They drink it.
                          (off Logan's look)
                      Corn syrup. Its in all those
                      drugged up drinks everyone's having
                      nowadays-- to stay awake, feel
                      strong, cheer up, sexy, whatever.
                      Used to be a time when a bad day
                      was just a bad day, you know?
                         
                                               LOGAN
                      Mine still are.
                         
            Will leads Logan to a PUMP HOUSE. A tangle of intersecting
            irrigation pipes under a canopy. The lock HAS BEEN BROKEN.
                         
            Logan looks out into the night, cautious.
                         
            INT. PUMP HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
            Will sets his tools down and looks at the pump. Someone has
            opened up all the valves and the place is now flooding.
                         
                                               WILL
                      Looks like we'll be here a while.
                         
            Logan finds a convenience store cigar in his pocket. Lights
            it. Enjoys the moment, wind blowing through the trees.
                         
            INT. FARMHOUSE - NATE'S ROOM - NIGHT
                         
            Rodeo trophies, posters, etc. The room of a kid who loves
            everything about that world. Nate -- ear buds in -- does his
            homework while listening to music. He looks up and sees--
                         
            LAURA standing in the doorway watching his every move.
            She looks at the trophies, curious.
                         
            He glances at her, but tries to focus on his homework.
            Erases something on his electronic writing pad.
                         
            She looks at the pad's screen. A series of equations with
            blanks to fill in and chicken scratch in the digital margins.
            He pulls out one of the buds, waves a stylus, and explains--
          Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                80.
                         
                         
                                               NATE
                      I'm not too good at math.
                         
            She stares at the equations on the pad, the screen littered
            with scribbles, things crossed out, then looks once more at
            the trophies...
                         
                                               NATE (CONT'D)
                      Those two are for breakaway roping.
                      Those for barrel racing. Those up
                      there are for pole bending. But all
                      second, third place. I'm not so
                      good at it. My dad makes me do it.
                         
            She just looks at him. Stares at him, really. Hears music
            coming from the dangling bud and looks at it.
                         
                                               NATE (CONT'D)
                      You wanna listen?
                         
            He puts the bud in her ear so that they now each have one.
                         
                                               NATE (CONT'D)
                      It's called "Devil's Whisper". It's
                      by Raury.
                         
            She listens to the music a moment, cuts her eyes at the older
            boy who can feel her looking at him. Takes a whiff of him. He
            finally pulls the bud from his own ear and gently passes her
                           HIS PHONE--
                         
                                               NATE (CONT'D)
                      Here. Take it for tonight. I'll get
                      it back in the morning.
                         
            She just looks back at him. He holds up his stylus...
                         
                                                NATE (CONT'D)
                      I gotta do my homework.
                          (holds out his hand)
                      Good-night.
                         
            She stares at his extended hand. Then looks at the screen of
            the pad. She takes the stylus and hunches over him and
            quickly scrawls on the screen--
                         
                                               NATE (CONT'D)
                      Hey, what are you--
                         
            Then he realizes that she's doing the equations. One after
            the other. Just like that. She finishes, then straightens up.
                         
                                               NATE (CONT'D)
                      How did you do that?
          Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                81.
                         
                         
            NOW she shakes his hand. He notices little ridges on her
            knuckles. Looks up at her as she puts the other bud in her
            ear and walks out. He sighs, goes back to his work.
                         
            INT. FARMHOUSE -- SPARE BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
            Charles lies in the bed, already asleep. Laura walks in and
            pads to the other side of the bed and curls up on the floor.
                         
            She lies there, listening to Nate's music. She clings to the
            WRINKLED PHOTO of the mutant kids, like a talisman. A hint of
            a smile as she looks out at the moonlight, eyes heavy.
                         
            EXT. PUMP HOUSE -- NIGHT
                         
            As Logan and Will finish closing and resetting the huge
            irrigation valve. A two-man job to get the giant bolt locked
            back down. As they work...
                         
                                                WILL
                      How long's your girl been that way?
                          (off Logan's look)
                      Mute.
                         
                                               LOGAN

                      Some ways I envy you. They get to
                      be Nate's age, the nonsense that
                      comes out their mouth. Makes you
                      question the point of it all.
                         
            Logan smiles, nods. Tell me about it.
                         
                                               WILL (CONT'D)
                      Hard thing, fatherhood. Never ends.
                         
            Logan considers Will a long moment as the man works.
                         
                                               LOGAN
                      You're a lucky man.
                         
                                                WILL
                                         (NODS)
                      I guess I am.
                         
            The WATER FINALLY STOPS RUSHING IN.
                         
                                               LOGAN
                      That should hold it.
                         
                                               WILL
                      Until the next time.

            EXT. PUMP HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
            Logan watches a TRUCK come up the road as Will puts a new
            lock on the gate.
                         
                                               WILL
                      Don't know why I bother.
                         
            He now turns and sees the vehicle as well. Steps forward.
                         
                                               WILL (CONT'D)
                      Stay here, James. I'll handle this.
                         
            Will walks forward with a thick wrench at his side.
                         
            The Truck pulls up. On the side it says CANEWOOD BEVERAGE.
            FOUR BIG MEN get out. All with weapons. One of them gets out
            on the driver's side, holding a rifle. This is JACKSON.
                         
                                               JACKSON
                      Evening, Mr. Munson.
                         
            Will just nods.
                         
                                               JACKSON (CONT'D)
                      What brings you out this way?
                         
                                               WILL
                      Why don't you ask your boys?
                         
                                               JACKSON
                      You understand, you're trespassing
                      right now, right?
                         
                                               WILL
                      I have an easement with the
                      previous owner of your property.
                         
                                                JACKSON
                      Previous being the operative word.
                          (looks at Logan)
                      Who's this?
                         
                                                LOGAN
                          (before Will can speak)
                      I'm nobody. Just a guy telling you
                      to get back in your nice truck and
                      play Okie dickhead somewhere else.
                         
            Jackson smiles, cuts a look at the others, then...
                         
                                               JACKSON
                      You hire some muscle, Mr. Munson?
          Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                83.
                         
                         
                                               WILL
                      He's a friend of mine.
                         
                                               JACKSON
                      A friend with a big mouth.
                         
                                               LOGAN
                      I hear that a lot.
                         
                                               JACKSON
                      Then you probably hear this, too.
                         
            And now he cocks the rifle. Logan nods.
                         
                                               LOGAN
                      More than I'd like.
                         
                                               JACKSON
                      Then you know the drill. I'm gonna
                      count to three and you are gonna
                      start walking away.
                         
            He nods to the dark field.
                         
                                               WILL
                      I got rights to this water --
                         
                                                JACKSON
                      One.
                         
                                               WILL
                      And I have a lawyer now--
                         
                                                JACKSON
                                     TWO--
                         
            And that's when Logan reaches out and snatches the rifle from
            Jackson by the barrel, surprising everyone. Especially when
            he slams the butt of it into Jackson's face.
                         
                                                LOGAN
                      Three.
                         
            Jackson goes down to his knees clutching his bloody face as
            the other three move on Logan.
                         
            Will pulls his pistol and hits one across the face, points it
            at the other two as Logan flips the rifle, points it at them.
                         
                                                LOGAN (CONT'D)
                      You all know the drill.
                          (fires above their heads)
                      Go.
          Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                84.
                         
                         
            They haul Jackson to his feet, throw him in the truck, turn
            around and drive back the way they came.
                         
            Logan breaks the rifle over his knee and throws the pieces
            into the field. He turns to see Will staring at him.
                         
                                               WILL
                      You've had training.
                         
                                                LOGAN
                      Some.
                         
            EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT
                         
            Quiet. A moment. As Logan and Will walk back up the road.
            Feeling good about what they've accomplished.
                         
                         
                                                WILL
                      Wish I had you around all the time.
                                         (HALF JOKING)
                      Sure you don't want to stay?
                         
                                               LOGAN
                      No, but I'll take a drink if you
                      got one.
                         
                                               WILL
                      Kathryn doesn't like booze in the
                      house.
                         
                                                LOGAN
                                         (SMILES)
                      Maybe I got something in the truck.
                         
            INT. FARMHOUSE -- SPARE BEDROOM -- NIGHT
                         
            Crickets buzz in the fields. A breeze blows. Charles lies
            awake, looking out at the crescent moon over the farm. His
            eyes travel downward to find-- Laura asleep on a hooked rug.
                         
            Then: A FLOORBOARD CREAKS and Charles turns to see-- LOGAN,
            in the doorway, in silhouette. He looks at Laura asleep on
            the floor, curled like a shrimp. He takes a step toward her.
                         
                                               CHARLES
                      ...Don't wake her yet. Let her have
                      another hour.
                         
            Logan looks at Charles. Charles lays back on the pillow
            looking out the window at the farm. Something stirring him.
          Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                85.
                         
                         
                                               CHARLES (CONT'D)
                      ...This was, without a doubt, the
                      most splendid night I've had in a
                      long time. ...but then...
                         
            As Logan takes another step toward Laura, Charles trembles.
            He does not look away from the window.
                         
                                                CHARLES (CONT'D)
                      ...I don't deserve it, do I?
                                         (THEN)
                      ...I did something... unspeakable.
                         
            Logan turns.
                         
                                               CHARLES (CONT'D)
                      I remembered what happened in
                      Westchester. This was not the first
                      time I've hurt people.
                         
                          (pain fills his eyes)
                      Until today, I didn't know. You
                      wouldn't tell me. We just kept
                      running from it. I'm done running.
                         
            Charles turns to Logan.
                         
                                                CHARLES (CONT'D)
                                         (ALMOST FUNNY)
                      I think I finally understand you,
                      Logan...
                                         (DEAD SERIOUS)
                      ...the burden you carry...
                         
            Logan arrives at Charles bedside. Puts his hand on Charles'
            shoulder. Charles cocks his head, perplexed, looking up at
            him in the shadows. Something is wrong.
                         
                                                CHARLES (CONT'D)
                      Logan...
                         
            LOGAN PRESSES HIS FIST INTO CHARLES' CHEST.
                         
            Charles GASPS. Logan pulls his hand back and that's when we
            see his CLAWS ARE BLOODY.
                         
            On the floor, LAURA OPENS HER EYES.
                         
            Charles LOOKS UP FROM HIS WOUND, blood coming. He tries to
            reach a bedside light and succeeds as again-- THE CLAWS
            PLUNGE INTO HIS CHEST. IN THE LIGHT WE SEE -- THIS IS A
            PERFECT DOUBLE OF LOGAN.
                         
            For simplicity's sake, let's call this creature BAD LOGAN.
          Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                 86.
                         
                         
            He will also be referenced as "X-24", his model number. He
            is a younger, stronger, clone of The Wolverine. Feral, he
            moves in a slight crouch. He is not the absence of emotion
            but rather, the presence of it, most noticeably, rage.
                         
            LAURA FLIES AT BAD LOGAN, SHRIEKING, landing on his back,
            gouging his flesh. He spins, trying to shake her, swiping at
            his back with his blades. He stumbles across the room and
            slams his back on the wall, crushing her, plaster cracking.
                         
            LAURA DROPS TO THE GROUND. Dazed.

            NATE STANDS IN THE DOORWAY, a Louisville Slugger in his hand.
                         
            His wide eyes take in Charles, bleeding, still moving, Laura
            on the floor, claws covered in blood. Then he looks to BAD
            LOGAN-- AND LUNGES--
                         
            A METALLIC THWACK as the bat connects with Bad Logan's head,

            The tinny transmitted sounds of the violence play off screen
            as we look at the Munson farmhouse a ways off through a
            windshield. PAN TO REVEAL--
                         
            WE'RE IN THE ALKALI COMMAND VEHICLE. PIERCE AND DR. RICE are

            Caliban stares, stricken, his face pressed against the bars
            in his cage in the rear of the truck.
                         
                                               CALIBAN

            WE SEE THE SEVERAL REAVER/ALKALI VANS nestled in an overgrown
            section of country road, among them the FLATBED WITH THE BIG
            BOX. Only the big doors are wide open... WE PAN TO --
                         
            The Munson corn field. Logan (regular Logan) and Will are
            coming down the irrigation road toward the Munson Farm.

                      imbibe much. Maybe once a month.
                         
            Passing the sheds and equipment, Logan crosses toward his
            pick-up truck as Will breaks for the house.

            Carrying Laura, BAD LOGAN steps over NATE'S GUTTED BODY and
            heads down the hall toward the stairs. We hear A SHOTGUN RACK
            and see-- Kathryn in her bedroom door with a two barrel.

            Bad Logan stares at her. Drops Laura.

            Logan grabs a booze bottle from the glove box. And that's
            when he turns, smelling something. The horses in the corral
            seem excited. LOGAN'S HEAD SNAPS UP.
                         
            GUNSHOTS RING OUT. SCREAMS FROM THE HOUSE.

            floor where Bad Logan dropped her, lying on her side.
                         
            FROM HER DUTCHED POV -- we see Bad Logan killing Will who
            tumbles down the stairs. We also see Kathryn dead, beside
            Nate, also lifeless. Tears fill Laura's eyes.
                         
            Pellets rain from above.
                         
            Laura looks up to -- Bad Logan, wounds healing.
                         
            She struggles in rage as--
                         
            Bad Logan picks her up moves to the staircase.

            WILL, LYING IN A HEAP AT THE BASE OF THE STEPS. GUTTED.
                         
            Then Logan sets eyes upon--
                         
            A DOUBLE OF HIMSELF COMING DOWN THE STEPS, CARRYING LAURA.
            A reincarnation of Weapon X. From the floor, Will's eyes fix
            on Logan, life draining from him.
                         
            Logan meets Bad Logan's yellow eyes.
                         
            Logan glances to--
                         
            The blood drenched stairs-- where he last saw Charles.
                         
            Laura watches, trapped in the restraints as--
                         
            Bad Logan suddenly moves away, with Laura toward the front

            In back, Caliban lies on the corrugated steel floor, beaten
            and bruised. He rises, peering through a slot. He sees:
                         
            Logan emerging from the front door, Charles in his arms.

                      were children, their emotional
                      responses could be manipulated. But
                      you can't nurture rage. You must

                                DR. RICE
                      No. No, no.
                         
            EXT. FARMHOUSE ROAD -- CONTINUOUS
                         
            Bad Logan keeps walking toward Jackson and his men.
                         
                                               JACKSON
                      I don't know what Munson's paying
                      you, but I'm willing to let bygones
                      be bygones. We could start you at
                      5G. A week that is.
                         
            He keeps walking. They cock their weapons.
                         
                                               JACKSON (CONT'D)
                      You best stop where you are, pal.
                      We're the law out here.
                         
            Jackson fires a blast into X-24's chest but he keeps coming
            toward him -- SNIKT! -- claws emerging--
                         
                                               JACKSON (CONT'D)
                      What in high holy--
                         
            Jackson never completes the thought. X-24 DECAPITATES HIM.
                         
            JACKSON'S MEN REACT IN HORROR, start to run, but he's on them
            like a sprung beast.
                         
            INT. ALKALI TRUCK -- CONTINUOUS
                         
            DR. RICE, PIERCE and THE REAVERS are fixated on what is
            happening but THE CAMERA FINDS --
                         
            CALIBAN, curled in a ball in the back, darkness in his eyes
            as he watches -- LOGAN at his truck.
                         
                                 DR. RICE
                                         (TO PIERCE)
                      He's confused. We need to
                      intervene.
                         
                                               PIERCE
                      You're the one he listens to, Doc.
                         
            CUT TO-- LOGAN AT THE PICK-UP
                         
            Charles' finger taps the pick up bed. Logan leans close to
            hear him say with a trace of a smile...
                         
                                               CHARLES
                      ...our boat... ...our Eden...
          Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                92.
                         
                         
            Charles tenderly touches Logan ...and then he passes.
                         
            Logan stares at Charles. Gone.
                         
            We hear the SHOUTS from Jackson's men as they fall, one by
            one. Only now does the sound of world seem to seep back in.
                         
            Logan dimly aware of the blood-curdling SCREAMS... He pulls
            the blanket over Charles, his eyes filling with rage.
                         
            BACK TO LAURA
                         
            She watches, immobilized as -- over at the Alkali Truck --
                         
            Dr. Rice, who's seen enough, THROWS OPEN THE DOOR and jumps
            down, gesturing toward Laura, shouting past to--
                         
                                DR. RICE
                      Twenty Four! Stop! Stop now! Get
                      the girl! Get back here!
                         
                         
            X-24 (BAD LOGAN)
                         
            slashing the last of Jackson's men, surrounded by corpses,
            turns to see DR. RICE.
                         
                                   DR. RICE
                      Come! Now!
                         
            A gunshot hits Bad Logan's shoulder. He spins. One of
            Jackson's men, not quite dead, has managed to crawl to a gun.
            X-24 crosses, lifts him by the hair and slits his throat.
                         
            INT./EXT. ALKALI TRUCK -- CONTINUOUS
                         
            Rice turns toward Pierce and the Reavers.
                         
                                DR. RICE
                      Go fucking get her!
                         
            AS THE TWO REAVERS GRAB WEAPONS, CLATTERING TOWARD THE EXIT,
            they hear a sound. Along with Pierce, they all turn to see--
                         
            A BOX OF MUNITIONS FALLEN TO THE GROUND, Caliban's long arm
            GRABBING ONE GRENADE AFTER ANOTHER, PULLING PINS and tossing
            them about the cabin. The Reavers lunge for the loose
            grenades. Caliban pulls a last pin and hold this one, meeting
            eyes with Pierce.
                         
                                               CALIBAN
                      Beware the light.
                         
            Pierce dives for the exit as...
          Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                  93.
                         
                         
            THE TRUCK IS ENGULFED IN A RAPID SERIES OF EXPLOSIONS...
            Dr. Rice knocked to the ground by the force, tries to get up
            and is driven down by another blast.
                         
            Laura reacts, her face glowing orange.
                         
            LAURA'S POV -- She can make out in the chaotic aftermath--
            Reavers on fire inside the glowing truck, Pierce stumbling
            from the wreckage...
                         
            X-24 sees Dr. Rice, on the ground, starts to move to him when
            -- HE IS BLIND-SIDED BY AN ENRAGED LOGAN.
                         
            Before X-24 can react, LOGAN JAMS HIS CLAWS INTO X-24'S CHEST
            OVER AND OVER, IN A FRENZIED BLUR OF RAGE, DRIVING THE BIG
            CLONE BACKWARD, BLOOD SPATTERING.
                         
            And X-24 just takes the beating, seemingly amused, THEN
            SUDDENLY DRIVES HIS CLAWS INTO LOGAN'S CHEST and heaves Logan
            like a stuck pig over his head, slamming him on a rock.
                         
            LOGAN lies there, bleary, his body ravaged. His eyes find --
                         
            LAURA, as she struggles to get out of her restraints, head
            bent an angle, watching (sideways) as--
                         
            X-24 finishes injecting himself with another booster shot
            AND THEN LEAPS AT LOGAN, ABOUT TO SPEAR HIS HEAD WITH BOTH
            SETS OF CLAWS when--
                         
            LOGAN RAISES HIS CLAWS AND, with all his strength, struggles
            to hold back X-24 PRESSING DOWN, THEIR BLADES INTERLOCKED.
                         
            X-24 is too much for him. Logan knows he cannot beat this
            thing, and he rolls from beneath him, X-24's claws spearing
            into the dirt.
                         
            Logan stumbles to his feet, X-24 doing the same and as he
            lunges again, Logan retreats, starting a crooked, delirious
            line toward -- Laura.
                         
            X-24 RUNS AT LOGAN FROM BEHIND, CLAWS OUT -- LAURA SCREAMS! --
                         
            AS THE CREATURE JAMS HIS CLAWS INTO LOGAN'S BACK AND SPINS
            HIM, THROWING HIM DOWN ON THE ROCKS. THEN--
                         
            X-24 SPEARS HIS CLAWS INTO LOGAN'S GUT, starts goring him,
            pulling blades upward, when he hears an engine, turns--
                         
            AND IS HIT BY WILL'S TRUCK AND CARRIED ON THE GRILL until
            he's IMPALED ON THE HULKING THRESHER.
                         
            Spattered in blood, Logan watches from the ground as --
          Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                   94.
                         
                         
            WILL MUNSON stumbles from the truck, bloodied, crazy-eyed.
            HE RAISES A SHOTGUN AT THE IMPALED CREATURE --AND FIRES OVER
            AND OVER-- shotgun hulls dropping.
                         
            BOOM! X-24 IS SHOT IN THE FACE.
            BOOM! SHOT IN THE CHEST, torso exploding.
            BOOM! SHOT IN THE NECK!
                         
            Logan crawls away, trying to get a footing. For a moment he
            meets Will Munson's eyes. Filled with bewilderment and rage.
            Blood comes from his mouth and he collapses, dead.
                         
            LOGAN hobbles to Laura. As he picks her up, he glances to--
                         
            A FRIGHTENED DR. RICE, still lying in the dirt-- and the
            wounded, charred PIERCE, crawling away from the Alkali truck,
            his cyborg arm blown off.
                         
            WE SEE A CRIPPLED BURNT FORM COLLAPSE IN CORN, CALIBAN,
            watching from a cockeyed view, with some satisfaction as--
                         
            INT./EXT. LOGAN'S PICK UP / CORNFIELD -- CONTINUOUS
                         
            Logan throws Laura on the front bench, climbs behind the
            wheel, starts the engine, jams on the gas.
                         
            THE PICK UP TRUCK ROARS OFF STRAIGHT INTO THE CORNFIELD,
            hard, tearing through the stalks.
                         
            Beside Logan, Laura sees Charles dead in the back and becomes
            frantic, pulling at her restraints, screaming.
                         
                                               LOGAN
                      Hold still! Stop it! Stop!
                         
            Logan reaches over with one hand and hacks at her manacles as
            he steers with the other. They say nothing more to each
            other, driving away into the night.
                         
            EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAWN
                         
            SEVERAL TRUCKS HAVE PULLED UP IN FRONT OF THE MUNSON HOUSE.
            Men in hazmat take away the bodies of the Munsons.
                         
                                DR. RICE (PRE-LAP)
                      It's alright...
                         
            EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAWN
                         
            DR. RICE opens his MEDICAL KIT and kneels over-- BAD LOGAN,
            EYES SHUT, POCKED WITH BUCKSHOT. THE CREATURE GROANS IN PAIN.
            HIS BODY HEALING.
          Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                   95.
                         
                         
                                               RICE
                      You did fine, twenty four. Breathe.
                      You're healing. You did well.
                      You're a newborn by any measure.
                      Just breathe. Your body has work to
                      do. Hemostasis, angiogenesis,
                      epithelialization, stromal cell
                      proliferation -- Here. This will
                      help with the pain.
                         
            He takes out A SILVER INJECTION GUN WITH A VIAL ATTACHED and
            injects a dose into Bad Logan's neck. Rice touches Bad Logan
            on the hand and he seems to lean into the touch.
                         
            EXT. WYOMING HIGHWAY - DAYS
                         
            Logan and Laura head north under a sign that reads:
                         
                               "WELCOME TO WYOMING."
                         
            EXT. STAND OF TREES, OFF THE ROAD - WYOMING LAKE - MORNING
                         
            Overlooking a small lake. LOGAN finishes covering CHARLES'
            GRAVE. Its physically hard for him to do this. Now he stands
            there, trying to think of what to say. He looks at--
                         
            LAURA, on the other side of the grave, a few steps back. She
            takes her sunglasses off. Takes the ear buds out of her ears.
            Ready to hear his words.
                         
            BACK TO-- LOGAN. He looks back at the grave, then out at the
            lake. Clears his throat. His eyes are sallow, his skin pale.
                         
                                               LOGAN
                      Well. It's got water and... it's...
                         
            Logan just halts. He looks down and sees-- Laura, taking his
            hand in hers, the same way that Kathryn did with Will at the
            farmhouse. She looks up at him.
                         
                                               LOGAN (CONT'D)
                      --its got water and it's --
                         
            Unable to contain himself, Logan pulls back his hand.
                         
                                               LOGAN (CONT'D)
                      ...Fuck this...
                         
            He starts away, limping, with the shovel. Only now do we
            realize just how ravaged Logan's body still is from his
            battle with X-24. Blood stains everywhere.
                         
            Laura stands there, staring as--
          Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                96.
                         
                         
            Logan stumbles to the equally ravaged pick up truck. He
            tosses the shovel in back and grunts something at Laura like
            "come on!" When she doesn't move, he curses and gets in the
            truck but it won't turn over. He starts cursing again and
            gets out and pops the hood.
                         
            A dog barks. Laura looks out across the landscape.
                         
            Downstream a quarter mile, A MAN crosses from a STATION WAGON
            with his labrador, pole on his shoulder, tackle box in hand.
                         
            Laura looks back down to Logan.
            He has collapses in front of the car in a heap.
                         
                         
            INT. URGENT CARE CENTER - TREATMENT ROOM - DAY
                         
            Logan lies, hooked to an IV on a small bed. He coughs and
            opens his eyes. He is in the examination room of some sort of
            small town walk-in clinic. The place is decorated in a Rocky
            Mountain style. Out the windows, granite peaks. An Old Doctor
            stands over him. He has a soulful face, a bolo tie and big
            belt buckle. Reminds one of Richard Farnsworth.
                         
                                               OLD DOCTOR
                      Welcome back. I was starting to
                      think I was gonna have to tell that
                      nice little girl out in the waiting
                      room that her daddy's gone.
                         
            Logan notices the EKG monitor connected to him. The Doctor
            sits down and smiles...
                         
                                OLD DOCTOR (CONT'D)
                      I always hoped I would get a chance
                      to meet someone like you. There's
                      so few of you left.

            He tries to sit up, but the old doctor puts a hand on him.
                         
                                               OLD DOCTOR
                      What you need is rest... and
                      treatment. You need to check
                      yourself in somewhere and--

                      No. You're not. I mean, I know
                      you're different. But that doesn't
                      change the fact that something
                      inside you is poisoning you. You
                      need to check yourself into a

            Logan pulls off the wires and tubes and gets up.

            Logan limps into the waiting area. Laura is sitting there.
            A Nurse looks up as the Doctor emerges, right behind him--
                         
                                               OLD DOCTOR

            Logan turns to-- Laura. She meets his eyes.

            Logan and Laura emerge from the Mountain clinic with a big
            sign with a red cross on it. Laura leads him, limping to--
                         
            THE FISHERMAN'S STATION WAGON. Yet another commandeered
            vehicle. She hands him the keys with a lure fob.

            He opens the driver's door and finds a booster seat made from
            bundled cardboard and a box of milkbones. Logan looks at
            Laura climbing in on the passenger side.

            Logan tosses the booster pile to the back and climbs in,
            brushing away dog hair. He starts the station wagon, but
            before pulling out, turns to her.

            She stops. She stares at Logan a moment, then very slowly in
            accented English begins to recite:

            She won't stop saying the names. A broken record.

            She puts his hand on the wheel.

            Find Pierce in a gown, upright on a field hospital bed,
            hooked to an IV, skin covered with burn salve and gauze.

            His stumped arm is exposed, doing its best to help his good
            hand repair A CYBORG HAND which sits on the overbed. As he
            glances out a side window, he tosses a screwdriver back to--
                         
            A FLESHY NURSE standing over him, fumbling with a tool box.
                         
                                               PIERCE
                      That ain't a torx, honey. That's a
                      phillips head. I need a torx.
                         
            Pierce glances again out the side window -- into the parking
            lot of a rural high school, cordoned off, thick with military
            vehicles, issue sedans, a command trailer and dome tents.
            Outside the trailer, Dr. Rice is getting harangued by a group
            of MILITARY BRASS and INTEL / CONTRACTOR TYPES.
                         
                                               NURSE

            Pierce snatches the tool he needs from the nurse and in two
            strokes, fixes his cyborg hand. Wiggles the fingers. Goes
            immediately to work, grabbing AN EVIDENCE FOLDER.
                         
            Inside is a collection of documents from the farmhouse, among
            them, Laura's wrinkled photograph.
                         
            HE PULLS IT CLOSE-- Gabriela and the X-23 kids. And another
            nurse, Maria, the one who sang on birthdays. He turns the
            photo over to read the scrawl on the back, then sees
            something else, something that makes his eyes bright.

            Dr. Rice enters swiftly from a hallway, pushing through
            plastic drapes as if hoping to lose the collection of
            government types who follow him into this tented gymnasium.

                      just leave a war zone behind like
                      you, like you did in Juarez. We--
                         
            The Major and his companions suddenly realize they are moving
            through a makeshift morgue. TWO DOZEN BODIES laid out as a
            haz mat team tags them. The bodies are mostly children,
            slightly off looking mutants. A few we might recognize from
            Gabriela's video. Also among them, Will, Kathryn, and Nate.
                         
                                DR. RICE
                      I'd appreciate it, Major, if your
                      associates would stop staring at
                      the dead assets. Try to remind
                      yourselves these were all little
                      killing machines, machines who
                      would have happily disemboweled
                      your family.

                      I was told you want these assets
                      off board, dead or alive. Are you
                      changing my brief?! Are you?
                         
            The people stop walking.

            Rice heads for a side door, pausing by another table where
            the BURNED CORPSE OF CALIBAN lies curled.

            Rice walks out of the school building, blows past an MP and
            the fleshy nurse, crossing into the infirmary tent. He finds
            Pierce getting dressed, pulling the IV, grabbing a crutch.

                      Look at that. Was found at the
                      farmhouse. I know. It's her. But
                      look at the other side.
                         
            Rice turns it to reveal-- The coordinates in North Dakota.
                         
                                               PIERCE (CONT'D)
                      Those are the coordinates of a fire
                      road in the Badlands. A reservation
                      near the Border. And, according to
                      Wikipedia, its also this.
                         
            He hands a tablet with the "EDEN EXODUS" X-MEN COMIC cued on
            the screen. Rice regards it skeptically. Thousands of mutants
            in Exodus, headed for the Badlands.

            A MEXICAN WOMAN looks up in terror as a door unlocks. She
            looks familiar, despite the bruises and blood. An armed guard
            looks up from a show on his phone.
                         
                                DR. RICE
                      Hello, Maria.
                         
            And now we recognize the name and face: Maria, the other
            nurse in Gabriela's video.
                         
                                DR. RICE (CONT'D)
                      So I understand that your mother
                      and son are safe at the holding
                      center in Guadalupe. We're looking
                      after them both of them.
                         
            Maria is sickened by the notion.
                         
                                               MARIA
                      Wh-what more do you want from me?
                         
            Rice takes out the tablet containing the X-Men comic. Her
            blanching expression immediately betrays her: she knows this
            place, knows what it means...
                         
                                DR. RICE
                      Connect the fucking dots, dear.

            She looks up at him, gripped by fear. Rice just smiles.

            Logan at the wheel. Laura shoves him and he wakes up, swerves
            back off the shoulder. She nods to the wheel, speaks Spanish:
                         
                                               LAURA

            He's barely awake. Barely alive, it seems. He's bruised and
            broken. Blood runs from his sleeve from some unseen cut or
            cuts on his arm. He turns to see Laura still looking his way.

            Logan turns to her. Looks away. To weary to say anything.
                         
                         
                                                LAURA (CONT'D)

                      To not let you.
                         
            She grabs the wheel, pulls to the right, taking them onto the
            shoulder. Logan tries to fight it but can't. Hits the brakes.

            the passenger side.
                         
            WE CUT OUTSIDE and watch Laura finish hauling Logan over into
            the shotgun seat. Then she walks around the station wagon and
            gets in the other side-- and lays rubber down the highway.
                         
            EXT. BADLANDS / BOX CANYON - MORNING
                         
            CLOSE ON -- LOGAN, who wakes with a start. Things are all
            crooked. He is alone in the station wagon.
                         
            He stumbles out the door to see that the front end of the car
            is nose down in a swale.
                         
            He shuffles, weak and woozy, following a path in the dirt,
            and then he sights--
                         
            Laura about a hundred yards ahead of him, hiking up a rise.
            Her eyes find his.
                         
                                                LAURA
                                         (IN SPANISH)
                      Come! Come!
                         
            She whistles loudly. A covey of birds fly out of the brush.
            Laura smiles for the first time. It is beautiful. Logan
            stumbles forward, follows her into a clearing which reveals--
                         
            A BOX CANYON. A STRUCTURE PEEKING OUT AT THE TOP OF A CLIFF.
                         
            Logan looks about, overwhelmed by the nature and, of course,
            the similarity to the "Eden" pictured in the comic book. He
            takes a few steps toward Laura but his legs start to give out
            underneath him and he falls to the dirt.
                         
            BLACK.

            CLOSE ON -- LOGAN
                         
            As he is jerked into frame. He stares upward, face in the
            sun, gently rocking to and fro. He is tied to a board a
            hundred feet in the air above the Box Canyon. He is being
            hauled up by who knows what.
                         
            AT THE TOP OF THE CLIFF
                         
            As Logan's conveyance arrives at the top, he sees that the
            people who have hauled him up are kids, about ten of them,
            some older, some younger than Laura, all looking down at him
            like they caught the biggest fish ever. They are all mutants
            children who have natural anomalies.
                         
            Among them, an African American boy, BOBBY, 10, (who clings
            to an armful of X-MEN ACTION FIGURES), a dirty blonde girl,
            REBECCA, 12, A dark-eyed goth-type, DELILAH, LIZARD BOY, and
            RICTOR, 14, a natural leader.
                         
            A faded sign on the nearby building reads "CAMP ANOLJEET"
            ("we serve' in native American). The doors have condemned
            signs on them. It is a run down version of the building
            pictured in the comic book.
                         
            Dizzy and weak, Logan stares at them, his eyes rolling up in
            his head as we go to -- BLACK.
                         
            INT. CLIFF TOP STRUCTURE -- BUNK AREA -- NIGHT
                         
            A flicker of light. Logan's eyes blink open, he's on a bed
            now, body weak, eyes heavy. He sees THE KIDS. Some of them
            sleeping, or reading or busy.
                         
            A few of them tend to Logan.
                         
            One of the kids (DELILAH) brings a wet cloth for Logan, but
            before handing it to him, she holds it under her breath,
            freezing it into an ice pack for his battered ribs.
                         
                                               LOGAN

                                               LIZARD BOY
                      Is this good, Rictor?
                         
            Rictor oversees Lizard Boy, drawing a few drops of green
            fluid from a vial into a syringe.
                         
                                               RICTOR
                      Not so much. Less.
                         
            Logan squints at the bottle. Grabs it.

                        Where did you get this?!
                         
            Some of the children step back.
                         
                                                  RICTOR

                        They gave it to us when we fight.

            Logan wakes with a start, screaming. There is only one child
            tending him. It is LAURA. She sits on a chair beside him,
            watching him. He meets her eyes, disoriented, shaken.
                         
                                                 LAURA
                        Pesadillas. ...you had night-mare.
                         
            Logan just looks at her.
                         
                                                 LOGAN
                        Do you have nightmares?
                         
            She nods.
                         
                                                 LAURA

                      I hurt people.
                         
            Laura takes this in. Then pulls something from her pocket.
            Logan's Adamantium bullet.
                         
                                                LAURA
                                         (IN SPANISH)
                      What is this?
                         
                                               LOGAN
                      You know what it is.
                         
            Logan nods, tries to sit up. In pain. She hands it to him.
            He rolls it in his fingers.
                         
                                                LOGAN (CONT'D)
                      It's made of Adamantium. Same thing
                      they put inside us. That's why it
                      can kill us. Probably killing me
                      now. Anyway, I got that a long time
                      ago. Kept it as a reminder of what
                      I am. Now I keep it to--
                          (looks at her plainly)
                      Actually, I was thinking about
                      shooting myself with it. Like
                      Charles said.
                         
            Laura's smile fades.
                         
                                               LAURA
                      I've hurt people too.
                         
            Logan looks off.

            Logan closes his eyes. The bullet sits in his open palm.
            Laura takes it.
                         
            BLACK.

            Logan awakes to hear children playing outside. He watches as
            some of the kids play a simple game of soccer. Suddenly one
            of the girls wiffs and kicks right past a ball and then
            continues prancing, her legs kicking high, arms waving like a
            puppet. Some of the boys laugh.
                         
                                               GIRL
                      Jonah! Stop! STOP!
                         
            Logan sees little Jonah manipulating the girl like a
            puppeteer. Everything he does, kicking out his legs, waving
            his arms, she is somehow forced to do, a mirror image. Some
            of the other kids come to her defense --
                         
                                               LIZARD BOY
                      Jonah, let go! Now!
                         
            It all ends suddenly when Rictor steps up behind Jonah and
            slaps him upside the head.
                         
                                               RICTOR
                      Cut the shit.
                         
            Another kid kicks the loose ball off the edge of the cliff
            and REBECCA, runs right off the edge of the cliff to catch
            the ball, then returns, walking on air.
                         
            Logan lies back in bed. Weak. But looking better.

            From across the darkened room, Bobby walks up to Logan. Logan
            considers him a moment. Bobby holds up an action figures, a
            vintage toy, the paint chipped. As if expecting a reaction
            from him. It's a Wolverine figure, then he holds up another.

                      was real. He was in a program with
                      me. Like what they did to you.

                      Yes.
                         
                                               BOBBY
                      But now you're doing good things.
                         
            Logan looks at the kid a moment, then--
                         
                                               LOGAN
                      Kid, I don't know what I'm doing.

            INT. CLIFF TOP STRUCTURE -- DAY
                         
            The sound of snipping. Giggles.
                         
            Then we see nearly all the kids standing around Logan's cot
            with glowing grins on their faces. Laura among them, although
            she slides into the back of the pack as he sits up. BOBBY AND
            REBECCA hide scissors behind their backs.
                         
            And now we see why. They have cut Logan's beard. Strike that.
            They have shaped Logan's beard into mutton chops. They have
            snipped off his moustache and soul patch. He touches his
            face, guessing what they've done-- and crosses, limping to --
                         
            TO A MIRROR. They all squeal in joy as he takes in his
            reflection. Then he glares at them.
                         
                                               LOGAN
                      Not funny. Not funny at all.
                         
            Rictor suddenly hurries through the space, moving from one
            room to the next. Logan moves after him --
                         
                                               LOGAN (CONT'D)
                      Hey, pal, how long have I been out?
                         
            But Rictor is already moving off outside--
                         
            EXT. CLIFF TOP -- DAY -- CONTINUOUS
                         
            Logan hobbles after Rictor, who passes Jonah, packing a
            backpack.

                      You've been sitting here two days?
                      You can't do that. You can't just
                      stay here forever.

                      We aren't. We had to wait. It was
                      the plan. Everyone had `til today
                      to find their way here.

                      Well, if you keep waiting those
                      assholes will find you. And kill
                      you all. You need to get out.

                      What do you think we're doing,

                      Si.
                         
                         
            INT./EXT. EDEN - LOOKOUT TOWER - DAY
                         
            Logan finds Laura and the other mutant children packing up
            belongings. The older ones lead younger ones-- loading guns,
            stocking ammo, prepared for anything.
                         
            Rictor is hunched over a short wave radio. There are voices.
            In French. He clicks off, crosses to the railing, addresses
            the others like an adolescent general:
                         
                                               RICTOR
                      That was the signal. They're ready
                      for us on the other side.
                         
            Everyone doubles their efforts. Logan joins Laura at an OLD
            MOUNTED TELESCOPE.

                                               RICTOR (CONT'D)
                      It's a ten mile hike through the
                      woods, and then, see that pass?
                         
            Laura nods, eye pressed to the viewfinder...
                         
            Logan looks out at a distant, rugged mountain looms beyond a
            swath of dense forest. There is a crevasse.
                         
                                               RICTOR (CONT'D)
                      Through there. That's the border.
                      That's where we can be free.
                         
            Rictor now turns to Logan.
                         
                                               LOGAN
                      Okay. Good.
                         
                                               RICTOR
                      ...Come with me.
                         
            Logan notices Laura watching him tentatively. As if gauging
            how he's going to react to something...
                         
                                                RICTOR (CONT'D)
                      Come.
                         
            ...Rictor takes Logan by the arm and guides him, still
            limping, to a closet --
                         
                                               RICTOR (CONT'D)
                      Laura told me all you did for her.
                      She was lucky to have you. Not
                      everyone was so lucky.
                         
            Logan glances back at Laura, still watching him carefully.
                         
            Rictor opens a cupboard and hands Logan what is left of the
            old envelope of cash. Logan stares down at the money --
                         
                                               LOGAN
                      Keep it. For your supplies or
                      whatever.
                         
                                               RICTOR
                      She says it's yours.
                         
            Logan pushes the cash back in Rictor's hands.
                         
                                               LOGAN
                      Yeah. Well. Look. I don't need
                      this. You do. For supplies. Buy her
                      some cereal.

            Rictor regards him a moment, nods solemnly and exits.
                         
            INT./EXT. CLIFF TOP STRUCTURE -- EDEN -- NIGHT
                         
            Outside, the kids all sit before a fire, perched on their
            rucksacks, eating from cans of food. Eager to make the trip.
                         
            Inside, Logan ties his boots sitting on the cot, observing
            them with a hint of nostalgia -- the chatty camaraderie, two
            of the kids goofing with their powers, laughter-- it tugs
            unexpectedly at him.
                         
            And then he notices LAURA staring at him. A little hard, a
            little cryptic. Logan turns to her.
                         
                                                LOGAN

            Laura abruptly rises and marches off. Logan thrown --
                         
                           LAURA
                         
            is about to go outside -- when Logan GRABS her arm and tugs
            her to his bunk area.

                      What's going on with you?
                         
            She ignores him, yanking her arm free --
                         
                                               LOGAN (CONT'D)
                      Hey. I asked you a question. What
                      are you pissed about? You're with
                      your friends. You made it.
                         
                                               LAURA
                      And where will you go?
                         
            Logan considers this a moment, smiles--

            She glares back at him-- clearly, yes.

                      That was never the deal. I got you
                      this far, that's all I signed up
                      for. I gave back the money --
                         
                                               LAURA

            She starts to move off again.

            Laura looks off, defiant, hurt.

            And she walks off.
                         
            ON LOGAN, watching her go. Resisting every urge to chase
            after her-- he SLAMS the door.
                         
            ON LAURA OUTSIDE, at the edge of the cliff, looking out at
            the stars as she wipes her eyes, the faint laughter and noise
            of the kids nearby. She glances back at Logan's door... then
            turns to join them.
                         
            INT. TOP OF CLIFF -- BUNK AREA -- PRE-DAWN
                         
            Logan asleep in his corner. He stirs awake.
                         
            He sees something near his face. A hypodermic and one last
            vial of the green fluid on top of a backpack. Beside it, a
            note: "NOT ALL AT ONCE. - RICTOR"
                         
            EXT. TOP OF CLIFF -- DAWN
                         
            Logan ventures out by first light. It's eerily quiet here
            now. All the kids are indeed gone. Laura too.
          Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                 115.
                         
                         
            Logan continues walking through the now-abandoned structure,
            reckoning with the choice he made.
                         
            EXT. EDEN - TOP OF CLIFF - DAWN
                         
            Logan is looking down at his station wagon still parked in
            the swale -- when he halts. Hears a buzzing, then looks
            upward and sees --
                         
            A flock of drones flying by overhead, fanning out.
                         
            INT./EXT. EDEN -- LOOKOUT TOWER -- DAWN
                         
            Logan bursts in, hurries to-- THE TELESCOPE -- the one that
            Rictor had Laura peer through yesterday. Logan brings his eye
            to the viewfinder...
                         
            LOGAN'S POV THROUGH TELESCOPE: the same distant mountain and
            crevasse that Laura had seen, five miles away, looming like a
            beacon, haloed violet by the rising sun.
                         
            Logan breathes, at once relieved and regretful. About to step
            away -- when he swings the telescope and sees --
                         
            LOGAN'S POV THROUGH TELESCOPE: something is moving toward the
            base of the mountain... black objects, rustling trees...
            Logan adjusts focus and sees--
                         
            A CONVOY OF MILITARY AND ALKALI VEHICLES...
                         
            Logan drops back from the telescope--
                         
            INT. EDEN CLIFF TOP -- BUNK AREA -- MOMENTS LATER
                         
            LOGAN GRABS that vial of green fluid and the needle. Throws
            them in the backpack, eyes fixed in alarm --
                         
            EXT. THE WOODS -- DAWN
                         
            Logan bounding through the woods... but he is already out of
            breath... stumbling...
                         
            Up ahead he starts to hear the echoed cracks of GUNFIRE,
            children crying out, shrieking--
                         
            Logan falls to the ground. Gasping, coughing, his wounds
            starting to reopen. About to lose consciousness, he reaches
            into the backpack, fumbling with the syringe and the vial.
            Draws everything in the container and injects himself...
                         
            Logan's eyes go wide as the drug hits his bloodstream.
            He screams.
          Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                               116.
                         
                         
            EXT. DEEPER IN THE WOODS -- DAWN
                         
            It's a free-for-all as the Reavers descend on their prey --
            the kids fleeing in all directions, desperately trying to
            find cover in the maze of trees, bullets spraying, among
            those running for their lives, Laura --
                         
            LIZARD BOY disappears like a chameleon into the bark of a
            tree to avoid a chasing Reaver.
                         
            Once the Reaver passes, Lizard Boy steps out from the tree,
            thinking he is safe, and turns to find Pierce standing there.
            He fires his side arm into the boy's chest.
                         
                                                LIZARD BOY
                      Ow.
                         
            Lizard boy drops to the ground and Pierce leaves his body to
            be dragged away by Reavers behind him.
                         
            NOT FAR AWAY IN THE WOODS --
                         
            DR. RICE rides in a jeep with two soldiers. He watches the
            battle ahead from a safe distance. Behind him lumbers the
            Alkali Control Vehicle.
                         
                                               RICE
                      Move faster. We can't let them get
                      to the border.
                         
                         
            ELSEWHERE IN THE WOODS --
                         
            ELLA is cornered by several soldiers, who advance on her.
            Her eyes roll up in her head as she draws on her powers and --
                         
            PINE NEEDLES LIFT FROM THE GROUND AND TEAR FROM THE TREES,
            swirling into a whirlwind. The needles envelope the soldiers
            in a vortex, blinding them, stabbing them, shredding their
            skin, filling their mouthes, gagging them.
                         
            A SOLDIER GRABS ELLA from behind, covering her eyes. The
            needles fall to the ground. As he proceeds to shackle her
            wrists-- LAURA LEAPS UPON HIM, SPEARING HIM WITH HER CLAWS.
                         
            Laura and Ella run away as other soldiers fire upon them.
            Laura tries to pull her friend, she is not fast enough.
                         
                                                LAURA
                                         (IN SPANISH)
                      Ella! Run faster! Run!
                         
            Laura takes a shot to the leg, stumbling, healing, limping
            but still moving. She looks back to see --
                 Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                               117.
                         
                         
                   Ella has been hit and is face down in the leaves.
                         
                                                        LAURA (CONT'D)
                             Ella!
                         
                   She crosses back to Ella to find her dead.
                         
                   Soldiers converging, Laura flees toward other children up
                   ahead. Some soldiers turn as they hear -- gunfire and mens'
                   screams from behind them --
                         
          173C     BEHIND THEM, IN THE WOODS --                                173C
                         
                   LOGAN SPRINTS THROUGH THE TREES. Speeding. Full strength.
                   We have never seen him before like this.
                         
                   He is Weapon X in a full berserker rage. His body restored by
                   the huge dose of the drug, he cuts his way through Reavers
                   and Soldiers one after another like a saw blade. They fire on
                   him but it doesn't matter, he heals instantly. Each of them
                   are gored and slashed and killed as Logan races toward the
                   children up ahead, overtaking the Alkali convoy.
                         
                   ANGLE ON -- LITTLE BOBBY
                         
                   running in terror as he's pursued by THREE REAVERS, their
                   bullets chewing up the trees around him, gaining on him--
                         
                   -- when he finally stumbles, peers up to see those Reavers
                   closing in on him, restraints and weapons at the ready when--
                         
                   --SNIKT! Logan appears from nowhere and kills them in an
                   instant. A guerilla warrior, dropped back in the jungle for
                   one last battle.
                         
                   ELSEWHERE IN THE WOODS --
                         
                   JONAH uses his ocular mirror connection, making one of the
                   Reavers AIM HIS GUN AT HIS OWN MEN, MOWING THEM DOWN. Then he
                   mimes his "puppet" Reaver into aiming his automatic rifle at
                   himself, shooting himself in the chin.
                         
                   ANGLE ON -- DELILAH
                         
                   Delilah is caught against a tree. She breathes on her
                   captor's arm, FREEZING IT. Then she shatters his frozen limb,
                   and the soldier screams as more Reavers grab Delilah,
                   restraining her...
                         
                   ANGLE ON -- PIERCE
                         
                   A Reaver brings Logan's backpack to Pierce. He looks at the
                   vial and empty syringe. He signals the troops to keep moving.
                   Concerned, he looks ahead to the convoy.
          Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                 118.
                         
                         
            ANGLE ON -- LOGAN
                         
            as he comes upon Ella, dead in the leaves. He pauses, seeing
            a trail of blood leading off and away. Sniffs it. Laura...
                         
            Then Logan sees PIERCE THROUGH THE TREES. Dr. Rice behind him
            in the jeep at the head of the convoy.
                         
            Pierce meets Logan's eyes as Logan starts toward him.
            Pierce also sees--
                         
            A REAVER IN A TRUCK AIMS A HUGE RAIL-GUN AT LOGAN'S BACK.
            HE FIRES.
                         
            Logan is blown backward off his feet. Sprayed with shrapnel.
                         
            The convoy continues moving after the children in the
            distance.
                         
            Logan pulls himself up from the smoldering brush to see --
                         
            LAURA up ahead, cornered by Reavers.
                         
            ANGLE ON -- LAURA -- SURROUNDED BY CONVERGING REAVERS.
                         
            She snarls and slashes at their rifles. But then she hears a
            primal scream and looks up to see--
                         
            LOGAN, sprinting toward her, eyes aflame. He slaughters the
            men surrounding Laura in a swirl of blood--
                         
            And then the father and daughter move on, chasing after the
            convoy, slashing through several more Reavers emerging from
            the woods to ambush them.
                         
            At the end of this father daughter blade Logan stumbles, out
            of breath, motioning for Laura to move on, as she slashes at
            one more Reaver.
                         
                                               LOGAN
                      Laura! Now!
                         
            Laura obeys, starts to run, but looks back at --
                         
            Logan, still panting for air. His fresh wounds not healing so
            fast anymore. Laura knows what he's done.
                         
                                               LAURA
                      You took all the medicine.
                         
            Logan looks to his wounds, then to Laura.
                         
                                               LAURA (CONT'D)
                      ...It's wearing off.
          Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                               119.
                         
                         
            LOGAN TAKES THE DEAD REAVER'S SIDEARM, stuffs it in his belt
            and leads Laura toward --
                         
            IN A WOODED CLEARING -- CONTINUOUS
                         
            THE CHILDREN run in a pack toward the mountains as fast as
            they can go. RICTOR at the rear, exhorts them in Spanish to
            go faster. He turns back to see--
                         
            THE ALKALI CONVOY GAINING ON THEM. Rictor doubles his pace,
            trying to catch up to the children when-- BAM! -- HE IS SHOT
            IN THE SHOULDER and falls to the ground, hard.
                         
            PIERCE LEAPS OFF HIS MOVING JEEP AND PUTS A BOOT ON RICTOR,
            looping a restraint around the boy's neck just as--
                         
            Laura and Logan come to a stop at the edge of the clearing.
            Pale and weak, Logan looks to Laura.
                         
                                               LOGAN
                      Go to your friends, Laura.
                         
            Laura takes a step but turns back as Logan adds--
                         
                                               LOGAN (CONT'D)
                      ...You'll know when.
                         
            As Laura moves off, Logan stumbles forward placing himself in
            Pierce's path to the jeeps.
                         
            Laura moves surreptitiously through the woods to gain better
            position on her captive friends. She eyes the two Reavers who
            stand on a jeep, watching over the children-- and two other
            Reavers standing watch nearby. Her eyes then land on--
                         
            Donald Pierce as he throws a bleeding Richter to his knees, a
            gun to the back of the boy's head.
                         
            RICE'S JEEP COMES TO A STOP BEHIND PIERCE.
                         
            Laura looks to-- Logan, clutching for air.
                         
                                               PIERCE
                      Green juice is wearing down, huh?
                      For an ol' mute, that a short high.
                      Gonna be hard to keep those claws
                      out soon.
                         
                                                RICTOR
                          (thrashing, to Logan)
                      Waste this dick, Logan!
                         
            Pierce knocks Rictor unconscious with the butt of his gun,
            then aims the muzzle at Rictor's head. He looks back up at--
          Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                               120.
                         
                         
            Logan, weak, standing there. Dr. Rice steps up behind Pierce.
                         
                                DR. RICE
                      Please stop, Mr. Howlett, or I am
                      going to have to tell these men to
                      fire on these children. You can see
                      the effects of the serum are
                      wearing off. You will not survive
                      any further wounds.
                         
            Logan glares at Rice, glances at Laura as she encircles the
            remaining Reavers guarding her friends.
                         
                                DR. RICE (CONT'D)
                      It's an honor to meet you. I'm
                      Zander Rice. I believe you knew my
                      father on the Weapon X program.
                         
            Logan's dark look goes darker. He holds up his bloody claws.
                         
                                               LOGAN
                      He's the asshole who put this
                      poison in me.
                         
                                DR. RICE
                      Yes he was. One of them.
                         
                                               LOGAN
                      I think I might have killed him.
                         
                                DR. RICE
                      I think you're right.
                         
                                               PIERCE
                      Shit. Show some respect, mutey.
                      You're lookin' at the man who wiped
                      out your kind.
                         
                                DR. RICE
                      My friend Donald overstates. The
                      goal was not ending mutant-kind but
                      controlling it. I realized we
                      needn't stop perfecting what we eat
                      and drink when we could use those
                      products to perfect ourselves.
                         
            Laura sneaks closer to two of the Reavers, poised to attack.
                         
                                DR. RICE (CONT'D)
                      To distribute gene therapy
                      discreetly, through, well,
                      everything -- from sweet drinks to
                      breakfast cereal. And it worked.
                                               (MORE)
          Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                  121.
                         
                                DR. RICE (CONT'D)
                      Random mutancy went the way of
                      polio. And we embarked on our next
                      endeavor.
                         
            Logan's eyes drift from Pierce to Rice to Laura, claws out.
                         
                                               LOGAN
                      Growing mutants of your own.
                         
                                               PIERCE
                      Dangerous times, James. We can't
                      trust fate to--
                         
            He lifts his pistol AND SHOOTS ZANDER RICE IN THE HEAD. The
            Doctor falls back, dead, in the grass.
                         
                                               LOGAN
                      Yeah. Dangerous.
                         
            Two Reavers lunge for their weapons but Laura surprises them,
            slitting their throats as--
                         
            LOGAN SHOOTS AGAIN, BLOWING OFF PIERCE'S CYBORG HAND-- and he
            is about to shoot a kill-shot on Pierce but the pistol
            clicks, its chamber empty.
                         
            Pierce turns and runs towards the Alkali control truck.
                         
            Logan stumbles after him, claws out now.
                         
            Pierce grabs hold of the control van door, throws it open--
                         
                                               PIERCE
                      It's showtime, boy!
                         
            AND A HUGE CREATURE LEAPS OUT OF THE VAN, BLIND-SIDING LOGAN.
                         
            It is X24 and he slashes at Logan mercilessly. The fight
            between them is bloody and feral.
                         
            Laura watches, terrified.
                         
            Logan struggles to stay on his feet, but there is fear in his
            eyes. He doesn't know if he can hold his own against this
            younger stronger version of himself.
                         
            The commotion distracts the two Reavers guarding the children
            who raise their weapons.
                         
            A THIRD REAVER lines up a shot, putting Logan in his cross
            hairs, when he is suddenly taken out by Laura.
                         
            Sensing their attention is elsewhere, young Bobby shifts his
            weight, extending his finger, eyes rolling in his head as --
          Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                               122.
                         
                         
            AN ELECTRICAL BOLT ARCS OFF HIS FINGER leaping to the jeep,
            ELECTROCUTING THE TWO REAVER GUARDS.
                         
            Laura turns back as--
                         
            X-24 GRABS LOGAN AND TOSSES HIM LIKE A RAG DOLL into open
            door of the control van.
                         
            Bleary, Logan grabs the fallen door, summons his remaining
            strength and smashes X24 with it, knocking the monster to the
            dirt. Logan reaches deep, bringing the iron door down like a
            guillotine on X-24's throat.
                         
            Rictor come to consciousness in the grass, his eyes finding--
                         
            X24, pinned on the ground, struggling to breathe, the van
            door pressing against his neck. X24 catches sight of Dr.
            Rice, his fallen master.
                         
            Pierce watches, his survival riding on X24's ability to get
            up and defeat Logan.
                         
                                               PIERCE (CONT'D)
                      Get up! Get up, boy! That's right!
                      He killed your Daddy!
                         
            X24 howls in rage and breaks Logan's hold, leaping at Logan,
            mauling him and hurling his limp, bloody body beyond the
            jeeps.
                         
            Satisfied with himself, X24 is shocked when--
                         
                                                   RICTOR
                      Laura! No!
                         
            LAURA LEAPS ON X24'S BACK and slashes at him.
                         
            Logan tries to crawl back to Laura to help her.
                         
                                                   LOGAN
                      Laura...
                         
            Pierce grabs a crossbow from the van and aims it at Logan. He
            fires, harpooning Logan's leg. He howls in pain.
                         
            Pierce ties off the harpoon able and tosses the crossbow and
            flees to his jeep, looking to escape but suddenly he is
            cornered by --
                         
            THE NEWLY FREED MUTANT CHILDREN COMING AT HIM, each enraged,
            aiming their fledgling mutant powers at him. They form a
            circle, trapping him, freezing him, entangling him, shocking
            him and burning him, all at once. Pierce cries in agony. They
            have no mercy for their lifelong oppressor.
          Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                               123.
                         
                         
            Bloodied and cut, X24 manages to get a hold of Laura -- he
            hurls her off his back into a tree... hard. She lies there,
            limp at the base of the tree.
                         
                                                RICTOR
                      Laura!
                         
            X24 crosses to Logan, weakened, depleted, preparing to kill
            his elder, when suddenly--
                         
            Rictor extends his hands and with all his energy projects his
            power to the ground beneath the Control Van.
                         
            Laura regains consciousness, noticing the empty pistol a few
            feet away from her in the grass. Then she sees--
                         
            THE ROCK AND EARTH BENEATH THE CONTROL VAN START TO HEAVE
            UPWARD and LIFT THE CONTROL VAN into the air...
                         
            Rictor screams as the power of his mutancy ripples through
            him and with one last push --
                         
            He releases the rocks beneath the van--
                         
            AND THE HUGE VEHICLE TOPPLES ONTO X24, CRUSHING HIM.
                         
            Meanwhile, the children stare at Pierce. He lies dead at
            their feet, mummified in ice, blood and twisted grass.
                         
            Logan gets to his feet and reaches out for Laura.
                         
                                                LAURA
                      Laura. You need to get out.
                          (to the other children)
                      All of you. Get out of here! Now!
                         
            Suddenly, the is a metallic CREAK AND KLUNK AND X24 EMERGES,
            BLOODIED, FROM BENEATH THE TOPPLED VAN. The children scream
            as the monster makes a run at them.
                         
                                                LOGAN
                          (to the children)
                      Go, go GO! Run!
                         
            The children comply, Laura most hesitant as --
                         
            Logan stumbles to position himself between the children and
            the unstoppable fully healed creature charging at him --
                         
            X-24 GORES LOGAN WITH BOTH HIS CLAWS and, using them like
            grappling hooks, drags Logan off to the forest's edge.
                         
                                                LAURA
                      No!
          Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                 124.
                         
                         
            X24 heaves Logan onto a fallen stump, A JAGGED WOOD LIMB
            SPEARING THROUGH LOGAN'S TORSO. Logan howls in pain.
                         
            Laura runs to the pistol in the grass. Pulls the Adamantium
            bullet from her pocket, fumbling to load the gun as--
                         
            Delirious, losing blood, LOGAN grabs helplessly at X24's
            claws (already plunged into him) as the monster jams them
            deeper, through him, and into the log-- then raises them for
            one last goring when --
                         
            X24's Adamantium skull suddenly explodes. He collapses to the
            ground. Done.
                         
            Laura stands ten feet away, holding the smoking pistol. Her
            eyes meet Logan's and she drops the gun and runs to him.
                         
            LOGAN AND LAURA
                         
            She hacks Logan from the tree stump. Logan slides painfully
            to the forest floor. He struggles to breathe. His body is
            decimated, his skeleton showing through his wounds.
                         
            Laura's eyes are wild and fearful. She can see he is mortally
            wounded... She kneels.
                         
                                               LAURA
                      no, no, no...
                         
                                                LOGAN
                      ...Take your friends and run. Go.
                      Listen to me, Laura. Run. They'll
                      just keep coming and coming.
                                         (GRIPS HER)
                      ...Don't be what they made you.
                         
            The other mutant children emerge from the woods. Stand
            quietly at a distance.
                         
            Logan watches them all, his eyes glassy, his body still.
            Laura takes Logan's bloody hand, and this time, he holds on.
                         
                                               LOGAN (CONT'D)
                      ...it's okay...
                         
                                               LAURA
                      No... ...daddy...
                         
            Logan looks at her. Then stiffens. Takes a short breath...
            And in his eyes, there is a flicker of wonder.
                         
                                               LOGAN
                      So this is what it feels like.
          Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                 125.
                         
                         
            And then his breath releases and he is very still.
                         
            Laura squeezes his limp hand. Disbelieving that he has
            passed. But there is nothing left in him.
                         
            Still holding his hand, Laura looks up at her friends, tears
            in her eyes. The other children gather closer.
                         
            WIDER ON -- ALL THE CHILDREN IN A CIRCLE AROUND LOGAN. They
            just stand there in the blast-radius of the carnage as the
            sun drifts lower in the sky.
                         
                                   LAURA (O.S.)
                         A man has to be what he is, Joey.
                         You can't break the mould.
                         
            EXT. MOUNTAINS - LATE DAY
                         
            The young mutants lower Logan into the ground. BOBBY has made
            a simple wooden cross for Logan's grave. Laura stares
            unrelenting at Logan as the dirt covers him.
                         
                                                  LAURA
                         There's no living with a killing.
                         There's no going back. Right or
                         wrong, it's a brand. A brand that
                         sticks. Now run on home to your
                         mother, and tell her everything's
                         alright. There's no more guns in
                         the valley...
                         
            The children all look to Rictor.
                         
                                                  RICTOR
                         We gotta go.
                         
            The children all grab their backpacks and start on the
            mountain trail to Canada.
                         
            But Laura hesitates, still looking at Logan's grave. She does
            not move, but then, tearful, grabs her own backpack. As she
            passes Logan's makeshift cross, she looks at it a moment,
            considering, then kneels and tips it on its side to make --
                         
            -- an "X".
                         
            The camera moves in on the X as in the distance, Laura joins
            her friends scaling the dark mountains, moving toward their
            future.
                         
            CUT TO BLACK.
